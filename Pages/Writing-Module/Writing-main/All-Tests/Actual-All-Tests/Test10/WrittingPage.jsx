                  The table illustrates how much money was given to developing countries by the USA, European countries, and other countries, between 2006 and 2010.<br /> <br />

                  Overall, it can be seen that the USA was the biggest contributor to developing nations in all measured years. In addition, European countries and other countries gave similar amounts of money to developing nations each year.<br /> <br />

                  In 2006, the USA gave over three times as much money to developing nations as European countries did, with a donation of $9.8 million. European and other countries donated $3.1 million and $2.8 million respectively. All countries increased their donations to developing nations<br /> <br /> over the following two years, reaching a total of $24.4 million.In 2009 however, the donations from all countries slightly decreased from the 2008 figures, with a total figure of $23.5 million. However, these figures saw an increase again in 2010, with a total contribution of $28.1 million. Of this, the USA donated $20.3 million, while European and other countries gave $4.1 and $3.7 million respectively.<br /> <br />

                  WRITING TASK 2 <br /> <br />
                  People have diﬀerent views regarding the importance of a building’s function in comparison to its exterior appearance. In my opinion, I agree with the idea that a construction’s purpose should be more highly valued than the appearance for a number of reasons. <br /> <br />

                  On the one hand, it cannot be denied that a magnificent looking structure can bring a wide range of benefits that should be taken into consideration. Firstly, it can remarkably raise the value of a building, especially a commercial or shopping center, as it looks more attractive, professional and high-class. The more customers are attracted to the building, the more profit it can potentially generate, which can benefit the building’s owners enormously. Secondly, a building with an  <br /> <br />aesthetic design can contribute a lot to the appearance of a city, and may make it become one of the most distinguishing places on the map. A lot of cites nowadays which are well-known for their architectural beauty have become popular destinations for tourists.On the other hand, the purpose of a building, in my opinion, is the key consideration when designing it. There are a variety of diﬀerent building types such as office buildings, commercial buildings, shopping  <br /> <br />centers, hospitals and schools. Each one of these has its own purpose and a particular interior design to serve those purposes. Therefore, only by focusing on the functionality of a design first, can we bring out the best use of a construction. In addition, people use a particular place because of what it oﬀers inside, not merely because of what it looks like on the outside. For example, if a company intends to erect a new office building, they will tend to choose the design  <br /> <br />based on the inner working spaces to enhance the operation of the staﬀ and the enterprise.

                  In conclusion, while the exterior of a building is an important factor, I believe its function should receive greater attention..<br /> <br />
