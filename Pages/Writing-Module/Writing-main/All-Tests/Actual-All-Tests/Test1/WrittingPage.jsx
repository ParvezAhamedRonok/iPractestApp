                  The bar chart and table compare five countries in terms of the percentage of families with high-speed internet access, and the change over two consecutive years, from 2001 to 2002.<br /> <br />

                  It is clear that the percentage of families with high-speed internet connection was highest in South Korea and the USA during those years. In addition, the biggest change in the number of families with high-speed internet access occurred in Britain.<br /> <br />

                  In 2001, about 11.2% of South Korean households had access to high-speed internet, compared to 9.3% of US families. One year later, the number of US families with high-speed internet soared by 170% to reach 25.11% of the population, which was the highest figure of all measured countries for those years. By contrast, the growth rate.
                  was significantly lower in South Korea, at only 20%.<br /> <br />

                  High-speed internet was not as common in Germany, Switzerland and Britain, with only roughly 0.35% of households having a high-speed connection. All three countries saw significant increases over the year, with Germany and Switzerland witnessing increases of 80% and 120% respectively. Meanwhile, Britain saw the biggest growth rate in high-speed internet connections with a 230% increase.<br /> <br />

                  WRITING TASK 2 <br /> <br />
                  In this modern era of continual scientific and technological advancement, artists are still gaining a lot of respect from people the world over. There are a number of things about life that the arts can teach us that science and technology fail to.
                  <br /> <br />
                  Many forms of art, especially literature, can deliver messages about the appreciation of what we have in life as well as life itself. Hundreds of literary works depict misery, misfortune and sorrow that still exist in life today, and this sends a strong message to those who do not appreciate their lives. “The Goldfinch”, for example, which narrates a story about the miserable life of the main character after the unfortunate death of his mother makes us wonder whether we have become heartless toward our own loved ones. I doubt that there are any technologies in the world that could manage to convey such a powerful message.<br /> <br />

                  Arts teach us to cherish the beauty of culture and is the fuel for our spiritual lives. This is extremely important in a world where science and technology seem to fade our belief in the gravity of culture in daily life. The connection between art and culture is boundless, and traditional music and ancient paintings can remind us of where we came from and who we are. That is to say, our cultural identity is preserved in various forms of art.<br /> <br />

                  Although science and technology advance our understanding of all things and better our lives, arts can touch us to a much deeper extent, help us value what we have, and remind us of the significance of our culture.<br /> <br />
