                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> Hi Aiden.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> It’s Kaeden. <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">(Q1)</span></p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> I’m so sorry.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> Don’t worry. People often get my name wrong; they never know how to spell it. It’s K-A-E-D-E-N, in case you ever need to write it.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> I’ll try and remember.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> So, there are a few practical things you need to sort out this morning. Then I’ll show you what you’re going to do today.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> The email I received said to go to the front desk, to show my letter of appointment and pick up my badge.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> You’ll need that for the staffroom and other areas of the supermarket where shoppers aren’t allowed. So, after you’ve finished at the front desk, I’ll take you to the staffroom. Put your coat and rucksack in one of the lockers there. Take whichever one is free. <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">(Q2)</span></p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> Will I have a key?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> Yes. Try not to lose it. At the end of the day, leave it in the door for the next person to use.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> Will do.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> You also need to go to the HR department to see Tiffany. She’s really helpful.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> I was told to bring my passport with me. HR need to take a note of the number in it. <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">(Q3)</span></p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> That’s right. Or you can show your ID card.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> I don’t have one of those.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> OK. Tiffany will give you a uniform. They have lots in different sizes, so you just tell her what you need. I won’t come with you to HR – I’ve got to go and sort something else out. Problem with a bread slicer. <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">(Q4)</span></p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> Is the HR office near the staffroom?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> The staffroom’s on the first floor, and HR are a couple of floors above that, on the third floor. There’s a staircase outside the staffroom. <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">(Q5)</span></p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> OK.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> When you’ve finished with HR, come and find me in the bakery section of the shop.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> I’m looking forward to getting started.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> I’ll just give you my phone number, in case you can’t find me. Have you got your phone there?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> Yes … OK, ready.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> It’s oh-four-one-two double-six-five nine-oh-three. <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">(Q6)</span></p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> So, Charlotte, your tasks today are in the bakery section, on the sushi counter, and on the meat and fish counters. The first job is to check sell-by dates on the bread and cakes. If any of the dates are today’s, put a new price label on the packaging.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> What if any of the labels are yesterday’s dates, or older? Do I throw those items away?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> Yes, but that shouldn’t happen – we check the stock every day. When something needs a new price label, put a yellow one on the package, next to the original price. <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">(Q7)</span></p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> OK.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> After that, you’ll go to the sushi takeaway counter.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> Will I be preparing boxes of food?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> For today, you’ll just be helping the staff.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> Yes, of course.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> You’ll see lots of flat cardboard boxes at one end of the counter. Beneath those is where we keep the plastic boxes – we run out of those really quickly, so you should bring more from the storeroom. <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">(Q8)</span></p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> Is that my only task on the sushi counter?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> No. You also need to clean the area where they prepare the dishes. There are cloths and bottles of spray by the sink. Oh, and please make sure you clean that too.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> Sure. That’s important, isn’t it?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> Absolutely. But you mustn’t wash up knives. You have to do some training before you’re allowed to touch sharp objects.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> What should I do if there are any?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> Ask someone to put them in the dishwasher.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> OK, thanks. I don’t want to get anything wrong.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> Don’t worry. You’ll be fine. And I’ll be around to help.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> Right.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> Finally, the meat and fish counters. You need to clean the area where staff serve customers, including wiping the weighing scales.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> OK. Anything else?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> The fish is laid on ice, but when that starts to melt, you’ll need to get more from the cold-room. <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">(Q9)</span></p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> I know the staff on the food counters wear a hat. Will that be the same for me?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KAEDEN:</strong> You won’t be serving customers directly, so no. But make sure you put on thermal gloves when you take anything out of the cold-room. The temperature’s low enough in there to get frostbite from touching things. <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">(Q10)</span></p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CHARLOTTE:</strong> Understood.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Representative:</strong> Hello everyone. Now, you’re here because you’re interested in travel, right? And you’re in the right place, for at EasyTravel, we have the best deals for the best locations. We specialise in eco-travel, <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">or holidays designed to get you amongst nature</span> <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q11)</strong>, ignoring the hustle and bustle of big cities.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Representative:</strong> If you look at our office here, you’ll see our overseas consultants. That’s for trips overseas, obviously, to Europe, to North America, but primarily <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">for the Asian market, which is generally more popular in this part of the world</span> <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q12)</strong>.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Representative:</strong> But they deal with the accounts in the morning, <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">so you’ll need to talk to them in the afternoon</span> <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q13)</strong>.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Representative:</strong> Mostly, by being closer, some of them can be done in a day tour. Yes, <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">it’s fast and convenient, with none of those long-haul bus trips which often leave you cramped and uncomfortable, and stuffing heavy suitcases into luggage racks</span> <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q14)</strong>.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Representative:</strong> We use the services of the famous Sleek Line Company, whose buses are known as the very best.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Representative:</strong> Now, let me tell you their specific functions. Firstly, <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">the consultant on the left, next to the plant, is the</span> <strong class="text-blue-600">‘Local Tours’ consultant</strong> <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q16)</strong>.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Representative:</strong> <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">Next to her is the ‘Interstate Tours’, and that can involve either buses or planes</span> <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q17)</strong>.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Representative:</strong> Now, as I said, <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">we can do international tours, and for that you need our big office, just through that door – the one between those two plants</span> <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q18)</strong>.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Representative:</strong> However, if your international tour is in the Asian region, which is generally our most popular option, then we deal with that in a separate room the one opposite International Tours, but not the corner one. <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">Just go through that door on the left – the one next to that cupboard</span> <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q19)</strong>.</p>

                </section>

                <section class="mt-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> So Jane – you’ll be off to Denmark soon to do your work placement.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> Yes, I’m really looking forward to it and I’ve just started packing up all my books to put in storage.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> Well, I hope they don’t get spoilt.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> It’s OK – my grandfather works in a bookshop and he told me how to pack them.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> Oh, that’s helpful.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> He says you have to support the spine otherwise the paper can come away from the cover. <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q21)</strong></p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> Yeah – that’s obvious.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> He also told me to pack them flat in the box not on their side – again because they can bend and if you leave them like that for, say, a year, it’s quite hard to get them back to their normal shape.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> Well, it’s pretty clear that ruins them, but a lot of people just can’t be bothered to protect their books.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> He always says it’s such a shame that publishers don’t use better-quality paper.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> It’s the acid in the paper that causes the problem, isn’t it?</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> Yeah – that’s why old books go yellow. You know some of the books my grandfather’s given me are like that already.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> Oh . . .</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> I should dump them really if they’re going to deteriorate further, but I’d feel bad. They’ll always remind me of him. He’s quite a collector, you know. <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q22)</strong></p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> Well, if they’re important to you . . .</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> Yeah – I’d regret just throwing them away.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> You know, maybe it’s because I was taught to treasure books . . . but I hate seeing students force open the pages – of paperbacks. They press so hard they end up breaking the spine.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> I know, but unfortunately, paperbacks aren’t designed to last a long time and people know that. Hardbacks aren’t quite as weak.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> Yeah, they’re different, I suppose. But I still don’t think people value hardbacks like they used to.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> Well, they aren’t decorative, are they, like other objects. Plus, nowadays, people don’t keep them out on shelves as much as they used to.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> That’s such a pity. When I visit someone – if they have, say, a colorful book on a table, it’s the first thing I’m drawn to. <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q23)</strong></p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> I agree – and book covers can be a work of art in themselves. Some are really eye-catching.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> I’ve always been taught to handle books carefully. If you watch someone take a book off a shelf, well, they usually do it wrong.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> Ah, my grandfather says, you should put your hand right over the top of the book . . . or if you can’t do that, pull the other books on the shelf aside so that you can hold the whole cover.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> When did you learn all this?</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> He watched me pull a heavy book off the shelf when I was small, and it fell on the floor and broke apart. <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q24)</strong></p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> Oh dear!</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> I can still remember it!</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> You know what I really like?</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> What?</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> The smell of new books.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> Me too.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> My parents used to laugh at me when I was a kid because I loved putting books up to my nose. Almost as much as reading them!</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> New books aren’t cheap, though, are they? <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q25)</strong></p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> I guess we’re lucky we can buy them.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> My grandfather stocks second-hand books as well as new ones and they don’t smell quite as good.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> I’d love to have a bookshop like your grandfather. What’s it like?</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> Well, it’s quite big – it’s got two floors and an attic, and he stocks all kinds of books really.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> I guess he treasures things like first editions and other rare books.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> Yeah – you might think he’d keep those in the attic or somewhere.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> . . . so they’d be hidden?</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> Yeah. But he likes people to know that he has them. So, he puts them out in the shop but makes sure you need a ladder to get them. <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q26)</strong></p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> Right. That would prevent any thefts!</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> Uhuh.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> Does he stock books for children?</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> He does. He particularly likes to encourage kids to read; he always says that he used to sit under the stairs as a child with a pile of books and read them all.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> Is that where he keeps them, then?</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> Not exactly – he’s got a dedicated area on the ground floor with cushions so that parents can enter with their toddlers, go there and spend some time reading to them. <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q27)</strong></p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> Oh cool.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> And then there’s a place for pushchairs by the front door. And a café if anyone needs refreshments.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> That’s good to know.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> As I said, it’s a big shop and there’s a storage area out the back as well.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> Oh, what does he keep there? Books he wants to throw away?</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> He hardly ever throws anything away – he just leaves unwanted books by the front door for customers to take. <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q28)</strong></p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> Well, that’s very nice.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> Yeah – and books people or institutions have requested, they all go at the far end. <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q29)</strong></p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> Oh.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> He thinks it’s best to keep these out of the main shopping area as they’re boxed and new.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> Did you get your coursebooks from him?</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>JANE:</strong> Naturally. He stocks books for a lot of the colleges. He used to keep these books on the first floor, but now there’s a new university in my hometown, he’s moved them downstairs to attract the students. They’re actually part of the coffee shop, on low shelves all around it. <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q30)</strong></p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>KIERAN:</strong> Pretty central then. You’ll have to take me there some time!</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">Tree planting now dominates political and popular agendas and is often presented as an easy answer to the climate crisis, as well as a way for business corporations to offset their carbon emissions. But unfortunately, tree planting isn’t as straightforward as some people think. When the wrong trees are planted in the wrong place, it can do considerably more damage than good, failing to help either people or the environment.</p>

                <section class="mt-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap">Reforestation projects are currently being undertaken on a huge scale in many countries and it’s crucial that the right trees are selected. A mix of species should always be planted, typical of the local natural forest ecosystem and including rare and endangered species in order to create a rich ecosystem. It’s important to avoid non-native species that could become invasive. Invasive species are a significant contributor to the current global biodiversity crisis and are often in competition with native species and may threaten their long-term survival. <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q31)</strong></p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap">Restoring biodiversity that will maximise carbon capture is key when reforesting an area, but ideally any reforestation project should have several goals. These could include selecting trees that can contribute to wildlife conservation, improve the availability of food for the local community <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q32)</strong> and maintain the stability of soil systems. Meeting as many of these goals as possible, whilst doing no harm to local communities, native ecosystems and vulnerable species, is the sign of a highly successful tree-planting scheme. To ensure the survival and resilience of a planted forest, it’s vital to use tree seeds with appropriate levels of genetic diversity: the amount of genetic variation found within a species essential for their survival. Using seeds with low genetic diversity generally lowers the resilience of restored forests, which can make them vulnerable to disease and unable to adapt to climate change. <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q33)</strong></p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap">Choosing the right location for reforestation projects is as important as choosing the right trees. Ultimately, the best area for planting trees would be in formerly forested areas that are in poor condition. It’s better to avoid non-forested landscapes such as natural grasslands, savannas or wetlands as these ecosystems already contribute greatly to capturing carbon. It would also be advantageous to choose an area where trees could provide other benefits, such as recreational spaces. Reforesting areas which are currently exploited for agriculture should be avoided as this often leads to other areas being deforested. <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q34)</strong></p>

                <section class="mt-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap">Large-scale reforestation projects require careful planning. Making the right decisions about where to plant trees depends on having the right information. Having detailed and up-to-date maps identifying high-priority areas for intervention is essential. <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q35)</strong> Drone technology is a useful tool in helping to prioritise and monitor areas of degraded forest for restoration. In Brazil, it’s being used to identify and quantify how parts of the Amazon are being devastated by human activities such as rearing cattle and illegal logging. <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q36)</strong></p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap">A good example of where the right trees were picked to achieve a restored forest is in Lampang Province in Northern Thailand. A previously forested site which had been degraded through mining was reforested by a cement company together with Chiang Mai University. After spreading 60 cm of topsoil, they planted 14 different native tree species which included several species of fig. Figs are a keystone species because of the critical role they play in maintaining wildlife populations. They are central to tropical reforestation projects as they accelerate the speed of the recovery process by attracting animals and birds which act as natural seed dispersers. <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q37)</strong> This helps to promote diversity through the healthy regrowth of a wide range of plant species. Unlike the majority of fruit trees, figs bear fruit all year round, providing a reliable food source for many species. At this site, for example, after only three rainy seasons, monkeys started visiting to eat the fig fruits, naturally dispersing seeds through defecation. <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q38)</strong></p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap">Reforestation projects should always aim to make sure that local communities are consulted and involved in the decision-making process.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap">The restoration of mangrove forests in Madagascar is an example of a project which has succeeded in creating real benefits for the community. Destruction of the mangrove forests had a terrible impact on plant and animal life, and also badly affected the fishing industry, which was a major source of employment for local people living in coastal areas. <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q39)</strong> The reforestation project involved hiring local people to plant and care for the new mangrove trees. Millions of mangrove trees have now been planted which has resulted in the return of a healthy aquatic ecosystem. The mangroves also act as a defence against the increased threat of flooding caused by climate change. What’s more, the local economy is more stable and thousands more Madagascans are now able to send their children to school. <strong class="text-blue-600">(Q40)</strong></p>
