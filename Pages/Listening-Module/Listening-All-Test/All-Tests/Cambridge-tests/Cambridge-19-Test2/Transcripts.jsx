                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>COLEMAN:</strong> Good, thanks.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> I wanted to have a chat with you because our friend Josh told me that you’ve joined a guitar group and it sounds interesting. I’d really like to learn myself.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>COLEMAN:</strong> Why don’t you come along? I’m sure there’s room for another person.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> Really? So – who runs the classes?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>COLEMAN:</strong> He’s called a ‘coordinator’ – his name’s Gary Mathieson. <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q1)</strong></p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> Let me note that down. Gary. . . . How do you spell his surname?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>COLEMAN:</strong> It’s M-A-T-H-I-E-S-O-N.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> Right, thanks.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>COLEMAN:</strong> He’s retired, actually, but he’s a really nice guy and he used to play in a lot of bands.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> Thanks. So how long have you been going?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>COLEMAN:</strong> About a month now.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> And could you play anything before you started?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>COLEMAN:</strong> I knew a few chords, but that’s all.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> I’m sure everyone will be better than me.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>COLEMAN:</strong> That’s what I thought, too. When I first spoke to Gary on the phone, he said it was a class for beginners, but I was still worried that everyone would be better than me, but we were all equally hopeless! <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q2)</strong></p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> Oh, that’s reassuring. So where do you meet?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>COLEMAN:</strong> Well, when I joined the group, they were meeting in Gary’s home, but as the group got bigger, he decided to book a room at the college in town. I prefer going there. <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q3)</strong></p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> I know that place. I used to go to tap dancing classes there when I was at secondary school. I haven’t been since, though and I can’t remember what road it’s in… is it Lock Street?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>COLEMAN:</strong> It’s just beyond there at the bottom of New Street near the city roundabout. <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q4)</strong></p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> Yes, of course.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>COLEMAN:</strong> The guitar club is on the first floor in Room T347.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> Right. And when do you meet? Is it at the weekend?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>COLEMAN:</strong> We meet on Thursdays. It used to be 10.30 and that suited me well, but now we meet at 11. The class that’s in there before us asked if they could have the room for another 30 minutes. <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q5)</strong></p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> Oh, I see. Well, I’d love to come, but I don’t have a guitar.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>COLEMAN:</strong> Well, you can always buy a second-hand one. There’s a website called ‘The perfect instrument’ that sells all kinds of guitars, violins and so on. I’m sure you’ll find something there. <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q6)</strong></p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">I never really planned to be a lifeboat volunteer when I came to live in Northsea. I’d been working in London as a website designer, but although that was interesting, I didn’t like city life. I’d been really keen on boats as a teenager, and I thought if I went to live by the sea, I might be able to pursue that interest a bit more in my free time. Then I found that the Lifeboat Institution was looking for volunteers, so I decided to apply. <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q11)</strong></p>
                </section>

                <section className="mt-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">The Lifeboat Institution building here in Northsea’s hard to miss; it’s one of the largest in the country. It was built 15 years ago with funds provided by a generous member of the public, who’d lived here all her life. As the Lifeboat Institution is a charity that relies on that kind of donation, rather than funding provided by the government, that kind of help is much needed. <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q12)</strong></p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">When I applied, I had to have a health assessment. The doctors were particularly interested in my vision. I used to be short-sighted, so I’d had to wear glasses, but I’d had laser eye surgery two years earlier so that was OK. They gave me tests for colour blindness and they thought I might have a problem there, but it turned out I was OK. <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q13)</strong></p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">When the coastguard gets an alert, all the volunteers are contacted and rush to the lifeboat station. Our target’s to get there in five minutes, then we try to get the boat off the dock and out to sea in another six to eight minutes. Our team’s proud that we usually achieve that – the average time across the country’s eight and a half minutes. <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q14)</strong></p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">As well as steering the lifeboat, as a ‘helmsman’, I have the ultimate responsibility for the lifeboat. I have to check that the equipment we use is in working order – we have special life jackets that can support up to four people in the water. And it’s ultimately my decision whether it’s safe to launch the boat. But it’s very rare not to launch, even in the worst weather. <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q15)</strong></p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">As well as going out on the lifeboat, my work involves other things too. A lot of people underestimate how windy conditions can change at sea, so I speak to youth groups and sailing clubs in the area about the sorts of problems that sailors and swimmers can have if the weather suddenly gets bad. We also have a lot of volunteers who organise activities to raise money for us, and we couldn’t manage without them. <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q16)</strong></p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">The training we get is a continuous process, focusing on technical competence and safe handling techniques, and it’s given me the confidence to deal with extreme situations without panicking. I was glad I’d done a first aid course before I started, as that’s a big help with the casualty care activities we do. We’ve done a lot on how to deal with ropes and tie knots – that’s an essential skill. After a year, I did a one-week residential course, led by specialists. They had a wave-tank where they could create extreme weather conditions – so we could get experience at what to do if the boat turned over in a storm at night, for example. <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q17/18)</strong></p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Since I started, I’ve had to deal with a range of emergency situations. But the work’s hugely motivating. It’s not just about saving lives – I’ve learned a lot about the technology involved. My background in IT’s been useful here, and I can use my expertise to help other volunteers. They’re a great group – we’re like a family really, which helps when you’re dragging yourself out of bed on a cold stormy night. But actually, it’s the colder months that can be the most rewarding time. That’s when the incidents tend to be more serious, and you realise that you can make a huge difference to the outcome. <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q19/20)</strong></p>

                </section>

                <section className="mt-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>BELLA:</strong> Hi Don – did you get the copy of the article on recycling footwear that I emailed you?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DON:</strong> Yeah – it’s here … I’ve had a look at it.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>BELLA:</strong> So do you think it’s a good topic for our presentation?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DON:</strong> Well, before I started reading it, I thought recycling footwear, well, although it’s quite interesting, perhaps there isn’t enough to say about it, cos we put shoes in recycling bins, they go to charity shops and that’s about it. <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q21)</span></p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>BELLA:</strong> … but there’s much more to it than that.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DON:</strong> I realise that now and I’m keen to research the topic more.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>BELLA:</strong> That’s great.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DON:</strong> One of the things I didn’t realise until I read the article was just how many pairs of trainers get recycled!</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>BELLA:</strong> Well, a lot of young people wear them all the time now. They’ve become more popular than ordinary shoes.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DON:</strong> I know. I guess they are very hard-wearing, but don’t they look a bit casual for school uniform? I don’t think they’re right for that. <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q22)</span></p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>BELLA:</strong> Actually, I think some of them look quite smart on pupils … better than a scruffy old pair of shoes.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DON:</strong> So do you keep shoes a long time?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>BELLA:</strong> Yes. Though I do tend to wear my old pairs for doing dirty jobs like cleaning my bike.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>BELLA:</strong> I must admit, I’ve recycled some perfectly good shoes, that haven’t gone out of fashion and still fit, just because they don’t look great on me any more. That’s awful isn’t it? <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q23)</span></p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DON:</strong> I think it’s common because there’s so much choice. The article did say that recent sales of footwear have increased enormously.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>BELLA:</strong> That didn’t surprise me.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DON:</strong> No. But then it said that the amount of recycled footwear has fallen: it’s 6 percent now compared to a previous level of 11 percent. That doesn’t seem to make sense. <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q24)</span></p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>BELLA:</strong> That’s because not everything goes through the recycling process. Some footwear just isn’t good enough to re-sell, for one reason or another, and gets rejected.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>BELLA:</strong> So let’s find some examples in the article of footwear that was rejected for recycling.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DON:</strong> OK. I think there are some in the interview with the recycling manager. Yeah – here it is.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>BELLA:</strong> Mmm. Let’s start with the ladies’ high-heeled shoes. What did he say about those?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DON:</strong> He said they were probably expensive – the material was suede and they were beige in colour – it looked like someone had only worn them once, but in a very wet field so the heels were too stained with mud and grass to re-sell them. <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q25)</span></p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>BELLA:</strong> OK … and the leather ankle boots. What was wrong with them?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DON:</strong> Apparently, the heels were worn – but that wasn’t the problem. One of the shoes was a much lighter shade than the other one – it had obviously been left in the sun. I suppose even second-hand shoes should look the same! <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q26)</span></p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>BELLA:</strong> Sure. Then there were the red baby shoes.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DON:</strong> Oh yes – we’re told to tie shoes together when we put them in a recycling bin, but people often don’t bother.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>BELLA:</strong> You’d think it would have been easy to find the other, but it wasn’t. That was a shame because they were obviously new. <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q27)</span></p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DON:</strong> The trainers were interesting. He said they looked like they’d been worn by a marathon runner.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>BELLA:</strong> Yeah – weren’t they split?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DON:</strong> Not exactly. One of the soles was so worn under the foot that you could put your finger through it. <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q28)</span></p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>BELLA:</strong> Well, we could certainly use some of those examples in our presentation to explain why 90 percent of shoes that people take to recycling centres or bins get thrown into landfill.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DON:</strong> Mmm. What did you think about the project his team set up to avoid this by making new shoes out of the good parts of old shoes?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>BELLA:</strong> It sounded like a good idea. They get so many shoes, they should be able to match parts. I wasn’t surprised that it failed, though. I mean who wants to buy second-hand shoes really? Think of all the germs you could catch!</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DON:</strong> Well, people didn’t refuse them for that reason, did they? It was because the pairs of shoes weren’t identical. <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q29)</span></p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>BELLA:</strong> They still managed to ship them overseas, though.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DON:</strong> That’s another area we need to discuss.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>BELLA:</strong> You know I used to consider this topic just from my own perspective, by thinking about my own recycling behaviour without looking at the bigger picture. So much happens once shoes leave the recycling area.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DON:</strong> It’s not as simple as you first think, and we can show that by taking a very different approach to it. <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q30)</span></p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>BELLA:</strong> Absolutely. So let’s discuss …</p>

                        For my project on invertebrates, I chose to study tardigrades. These are microscopic — or to be more precise — near-microscopic animals. There are well over a thousand known species of these tiny animals, which belong to the phylum Tardigrada. Most tardigrades range in length from 0.05 to 1 millimetre, though the largest species can grow to be 1.2 millimetres in length. They are also sometimes called ‘water bears’: ‘water’ because that’s where they thrive best, and ‘bear’ because of the way they move. <span class="font-bold text-green-500">(Q31)</span> ‘Moss piglet’ is another name for tardigrades because of the way they look when viewed from the front. They were first discovered in Germany in 1773 by Johann Goeze, who coined the name Tardigrada.

                        As I say, there are many different species of tardigrade — too many to describe here — but, generally speaking, the different species share similar physical traits. They have a body which is short, <span class="font-bold text-green-500">(Q32)</span>, and also rounded — a bit like a barrel — and the body comprises four segments. Each segment has a pair of legs, at the end of which are between four and eight sharp claws. I should also say that some species don’t have any claws: what they have are discs, <span class="font-bold text-green-500">(Q33)</span>, and these work by means of suction. They enable the tardigrade to cling to surfaces or to grip its prey. Within the body, there are no lungs, or any organs for breathing at all. Instead, oxygen and also blood are transported in a fluid that fills the cavity of the body. <span class="font-bold text-green-500">(Q34)</span>

                        As far as the tardigrade’s head is concerned, the best way I can describe this is that it looks rather strange — a bit squashed even — though many of the websites I looked at described its appearance as cute, which isn’t exactly very scientific. The tardigrade’s mouth is a kind of tube <span class="font-bold text-green-500">(Q35)</span> that can open outwards to reveal teeth-like structures known as ‘stylets’. These are sharp enough to pierce plant or animal cells.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
                        So, where are tardigrades found? Well, they live in every part of the world, in a variety of habitats: most commonly, on the bed of a lake, or on many kinds of plants or in very wet environments. There’s been some interesting research which has found that tardigrades are capable of surviving radiation and very high pressure, and they’re also able to withstand temperatures as low as minus –200 degrees centigrade, or highs of more than 148 degrees centigrade, <span class="font-bold text-green-500">(Q36)</span>, which is incredibly hot.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
                        It has been said that tardigrades could survive long after human beings have been wiped out, even in the event of an asteroid hitting the earth. If conditions become too extreme and tardigrades are at risk of drying out, they enter a state called cryptobiosis. They form a little ball, called a tun — that’s T-U-N — by retracting their head and legs, and their metabolism drops to less than one percent of normal levels. They can stay in this state for decades, and if re-introduced to water, when they will come back to life in a matter of a few hours. While in this state of cryptobiosis, tardigrades produce a protein that protects their DNA. <span class="font-bold text-green-500">(Q37)</span> In 2016, scientists revived two tardigrades that had been tuns for more than 30 years. There was a report that, in 1948, a 120-year-old tun was revived, but this experiment has never been repeated. There are currently several tests taking place in space, to determine how long tardigrades might be able to survive there. <span class="font-bold text-green-500">(Q38)</span> I believe the record so far is 10 days.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
                        So, erm, moving on. In terms of their diet, tardigrades consume liquids in order to survive. Although they have teeth, they don’t use these for chewing. They suck the juices from moss, or extract fluid from seaweed, <span class="font-bold text-green-500">(Q39)</span>, but some species prey on other tardigrades, from other species or within their own. I suppose this isn’t surprising, given that tardigrades are mainly comprised of liquid and are coated with a type of gel.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
                        Finally, I’d like to mention the conservation status of tardigrades. It is estimated that they have been in existence for approximately half a billion years and, in that time, they have survived five mass extinctions. So, it will probably come as no surprise to you, that tardigrades have not been evaluated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and are not on any endangered list. <span class="font-bold text-green-500">(Q40)</span> Some researchers have described them as thriving.
