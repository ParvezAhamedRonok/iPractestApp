                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> Jack, I’m thinking of taking the kids to the seaside on a surfing holiday this summer and I wanted to ask your advice – as I know you’re such an expert.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JACK:</strong> Well, I don’t know about that, but yes, I’ve done a bit of surfing over the years. I’d thoroughly recommend it. I think it’s the kind of holiday all the family can enjoy together <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q1)</strong>. The thing about surfing is that it’s great for all ages and all abilities. My youngest started when he was only three!</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> Wow! But it’s quite physically demanding, isn’t it? I’ve heard you need to be pretty fit. <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q2)</strong></p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JACK:</strong> Yes. You’ll certainly learn more quickly and won’t tire as easily.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> Well – that should be OK for us. You’ve been surfing a few times in Ireland, haven’t you?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JACK:</strong> Yes. There’s some great surfing there, which people don’t always realise.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> And which locations would you recommend? – there seem to be quite a few.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JACK:</strong> Yes, there are loads. Last year we went to County Donegal. There are several great places to surf there.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> What about in County Clare? I read that’s also really good for surfing.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JACK:</strong> Yes, it is. I’ve been there a few times. Most people go to Lahinch. My kids love it there. The waves aren’t too challenging and the town is very lively.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> Are there good hotels there? <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q3)</strong></p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JACK:</strong> Yes – some very nice ones and there are also a few basic hostels and campsites. It’s great if you need lessons as the surf schools are excellent.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> Sounds good.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JACK:</strong> Yes and there’s lots to see in the area – like those well-known cliffs – … I’ve forgotten the name of them …</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> Oh don’t worry – I can look them up.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JACK:</strong> I’ve also been surfing in County Mayo, which is less well-known for surfing, but we had a really good time. That was a few years ago when the kids were younger. There’s a good surf school at Carrowniskey beach. <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q4)</strong></p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> How do you spell that?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JACK:</strong> C-A-double R-O-W-N-I-S-K-E-Y</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> OK.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JACK:</strong> I put the kids into the surf camp they run during the summer for 10-16 year olds.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> Oh right. How long was that for?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JACK:</strong> Three hours every day for a week <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q5)</strong>. It was perfect – they were so tired out after that.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> I can imagine.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JACK:</strong> One thing we did while the kids were surfing was to rent some kayaks to have a look around the bay which is nearby <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q6)</strong>. It’s really beautiful.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> Oh, I’d love to do that.</p>
                </section>

                <section className="mt-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> Now the only time I went to Ireland it rained practically every day.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JACK:</strong> Mmm yes – that can be a problem – but you can surf in the rain, you know.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> It doesn’t have the same appeal, somehow.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JACK:</strong> Well, the weather’s been fine the last couple of years when I’ve been there, but actually, it tends to rain more in August than in the spring or autumn. September’s my favourite month because the water is warmer then. <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q7)</strong></p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> The only problem is that the kids are back to school then.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JACK:</strong> I know. But one good thing about Irish summers is that it doesn’t get too hot. The average temperature is about 19 degrees <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q8)</strong> and it usually doesn’t go above 25 degrees.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> That sounds alright. Now what about costs?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JACK:</strong> Surfing is a pretty cheap holiday really – the only cost is the hire of equipment. You can expect to pay a daily rate of about 30 euros for the hire of a wetsuit and board <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q9)</strong> – but you can save about 40 euros if you hire by the week.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> That’s not too bad.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JACK:</strong> No. It’s important to make sure you get good quality wetsuits – you’ll all get too cold if you don’t. And make sure you also get boots. They keep your feet warm and it’s easier to surf with them on too. <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q10)</strong></p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WOMAN:</strong> OK. Well, thanks very much …</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Good afternoon. My name’s Mrs. Carter and I run the before and after school extended hours childcare service. I hope you’ve had a chance to have a good look around the school and talk to staff and pupils. I know that many of you are interested in using our childcare service when your child joins the school, and perhaps you already know something about it, but for those that don’t, I’ll go through the main details now.</p>
                </section>

                <section className="mt-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">We offer childcare for children from the ages of four to eleven both before and after school. I know that many parents who work find this service invaluable. You can leave your child with us safe in the knowledge that they will be extremely well cared for.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">We are insured to provide care for up to 70 children <span className="font-bold">[Q11/12]</span>, although we rarely have this many attending at any one session. I think we generally expect around 50-60 children for the afternoon sessions and about half that number for the breakfast sessions <span className="font-bold">[Q11/12]</span>. Although we currently do have 70 children registered with us, not all of these attend every day. It’s ten years since we began offering an extended hours service and we’ve come a long way during that time. When we first opened, we only had about 20 children attending regularly.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">We try to keep our costs as low as we can and we think we provide very good value for money. For the afternoon sessions, which run from 3.30 until 6 p.m., it’s £7.20 <span className="font-bold">[Q13]</span>. But if you prefer, you can pay for one hour only, which costs £3.50, or two hours which costs £5.70.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">The cost of the childcare includes food and snacks. They’ll be given breakfast in the morning and in the afternoon, a healthy snack as soon as they finish school. At 5 p.m. children are given something more substantial, such as pasta or a casserole <span className="font-bold">[Q14]</span>. Please inform us of any allergies that your child might have and we’ll make sure they’re offered a suitable alternative.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">As you may know, the childcare service runs through the school holidays from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. We offer a really varied and exciting programme to keep the children entertained – we don’t want them to feel as if they are still at school! It will also feel different because they’ll get the chance to make new friends with children from other schools – spaces are available for them <span className="font-bold">[Q15]</span> because a lot of our term-time children don’t always attend during the holiday. In the past, parents have asked if children over the age of 11 are allowed to come with their younger brothers and sisters – but I’m afraid we’re unable to do this because of the type of insurance we have.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">So now let me tell you about some of the activities that your child can do during the after-school sessions. As well as being able to use the playground equipment, computers and the library, there is usually at least one ‘special’ activity that children can do each day. For example, Spanish. We have a specialist teacher coming in every Thursday to give a basic introduction to the language through games and songs. She does two sessions: one for the over 8s and one for the younger children. This is the only activity which we have to make an extra charge for <span className="font-bold">[Q16]</span> – but it’s well worth it.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Once a week the children have the opportunity to do some music. We’re very lucky that one of our staff is a member of a folk band. On Mondays, she teaches singing and percussion to groups of children. We do rely on parental support for this <span className="font-bold">[Q17]</span>, so if any of you sing or play an instrument and would be prepared to help out at these sessions, we’d be delighted.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Painting continues to be one of the most popular activities. To begin with we weren’t keen on offering this because of the extra mess involved, but children kept asking if they could do some art <span className="font-bold">[Q18]</span> and so we finally gave in. Art is great for helping the children to relax after working hard at school all day.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Yoga is something that we’ve been meaning to introduce for some time but haven’t been able to find anyone available to teach it – until now that is <span className="font-bold">[Q19]</span>. So we’ll see how this goes. Hopefully, children will benefit in all sorts of ways from this.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Cooking is another popular activity. They make a different sort of cake, or pizza or bread each week. Although the younger children love doing it, we found that the mess was just too much, so we’ve decided to restrict this to the over 8s <span className="font-bold">[Q20]</span>, as they are better able to clean up after themselves.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    Hello Dr Green – I’m here to talk to you about my work placement.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   Oh yes, it’s Holly, isn’t it?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    Yes.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   So, which work placement have you chosen?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    I decided to go for the Orion Stadium placement. The event I’ll be managing is one where I’m helping to set up a sports competition for primary school children.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   Yup. That’s always a popular placement – even though it can be tougher than you think working with children.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    I know, but it’s the fresh air that attracts me – organising something indoors doesn’t have the same appeal <span className="font-bold">[Q21]</span>, even though it might be fun.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   OK, so obviously safety’s going to be one of your key concerns for this event.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    Yes, I’ve already thought about that. I’ll need to make sure none of the equipment’s damaged.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   Ah well, you’ll be working with schools, so the equipment will be their responsibility. However, the grounds and what goes on there will be yours.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    Oh I see – that’ll include keeping everyone within the boundary <span className="font-bold">[Q22]</span> once they’re in their kit and on the field?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   Exactly – you’ll need to inspect areas like changing rooms as well for anything someone can trip over, but your main priority will be not to lose anyone!</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    Right. I’ll need staff to help with that.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   And don’t forget about the spectators.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    Mmm. I was thinking that many of them will be parents, who could help run the event.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   I wouldn’t rely on that. They’ll be more interested in filming their children than volunteering.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    I’ll need to make sure they don’t interfere with events doing that!</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   And that’s not always easy, especially when a proud parent’s trying to get a snap of their child and you want them to move elsewhere. <span className="font-bold">[Q23]</span></p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    OK. What about the scheduling?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   With sporting events there are all sorts of things that can alter the timetable – like rain, for instance – though so far, we’ve always been lucky with that.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    Yeah, and I was thinking about what to do if someone got hurt as well. I know that last year that caused a terrible delay. <span className="font-bold">[Q24]</span></p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   You have to be prepared for such things.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    Oh. What if a match ends in a draw – do you let the teams keep going until someone wins?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   That’ll be up to you – and again, you need to plan for it.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    Right.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   Now, the aim of your work placement is to give you the opportunity to develop the skills that an events manager needs. So, let’s talk about those a bit.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    Well, I think my communication skills are pretty good. I can talk on the phone to people and book venues and that kind of thing.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   Good – just remember it isn’t only about what you say. If you meet someone face-to-face and want to persuade them to be a sponsor, for example … <span className="font-bold">[Q25]</span></p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    Oh, I’ll dress up for that! Sure.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   Good. Let’s go on to think about your organisational skills. You’re working in a very people-based industry and that means things won’t always go to plan.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    I guess it’s being prepared to make changes that matters. <span className="font-bold">[Q26]</span></p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   That’s right. You may have to make an on-the-spot change to a timetable because of a problem you hadn’t anticipated …</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    … just do it! OK</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   How’s your time management these days?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    I’m working on it – I’m certainly better when I have a deadline, which is why this work suits me.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   Yes, but it’s how you respond as that deadline approaches! <span className="font-bold">[Q27]</span></p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    I know I’ve got to look calm even if I’m in a panic.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   Just think to yourself – no one must know I’m under pressure.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    Yeah – even though I’m multi-tasking like crazy!</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   Another skill that events managers need is creativity. Often your client has what we call the ‘big picture’ idea, but it’s up to the events manager to think of all the fine points that go to making it work. <span className="font-bold">[Q28]</span></p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    Right, so I need to listen carefully to that idea and then fill in all the gaps.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   That’s right. And you’ll have a team working under you, so another key skill is leadership. Your team may have lots of ideas too, but you’ve got to make the ultimate choices. Do we have refreshments inside or out, for example?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    Isn’t it better to be democratic?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   It’s a nice idea, but you have the ultimate responsibility. So, believe in what you think best <span className="font-bold">[Q29]</span>. Be prepared to say ‘yes’, that’s a good idea but it won’t work here.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    I see what you mean. What about the networking side of things? I know it’s an area that a lot of students worry about because we don’t have much experience to offer others.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   But even without it – you can still be an interesting person with useful ideas. And the more people you impress, the better.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    I guess that will help me when I apply for a real job. <span className="font-bold">[Q30]</span></p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR:   Exactly – think ahead – remember what your ambitions are and keep them in mind.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">HOLLY:    Definitely.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Scientists believe that a majority of the earth’s bird population migrate in some fashion or other. Some travel seasonally for relatively short distances, such as birds that move from their winter habitats in lowlands to mountain tops for the summers. Others, like the Arctic Tern, travel more than 25,000 miles seasonally between the northern and southern poles. Bird migration has been studied over many centuries through a variety of observations.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">But until relatively recently, where birds went to in the winter was considered something of a mystery. The lack of modern science and technology led to many theories that we now recognize as error-filled and even somewhat amusing. Take hibernation theory for example – two thousand years ago, it was commonly believed that when birds left an area, they went underwater to hibernate in the seas and oceans. Another theory for the regular appearance and disappearance of birds was that they spend winter hidden in mud <span className="font-bold">[Q31]</span> till the weather changed and food became abundant again. The theory that some birds hibernate persisted until experiments were done on caged birds in the 1940s which demonstrated that birds have no hibernation instinct.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">One of the earliest naturalists and philosophers from ancient Greece was Aristotle who was the first writer to discuss the disappearance and reappearance of some bird species at certain times of year. He developed the theory of transmutation, the seasonal change of one species into another, by observing redstarts and robins. He observed that in the autumn, small birds called ‘redstarts’ began to lose their feathers <span className="font-bold">[Q32]</span>, which convinced Aristotle that they changed into robins for the winter, and back into redstarts in the summer. These assumptions are understandable given that this pair of species are similar in shape <span className="font-bold">[Q33]</span>, but are a classic example of an incorrect interpretation based on correct observations.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">The most bizarre theory was put forward by an English amateur scientist, Charles Morton, in the seventeenth century. He wrote a surprisingly well-regarded paper claiming that birds migrate to the moon and back every year <span className="font-bold">[Q34]</span>. He came to this conclusion as the only logical explanation for the total disappearance of some species.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">One of the key moments in the development of migration theory came in 1822 when a white stork was shot in Germany. This particular stork made history because of the long spear in its neck <span className="font-bold">[Q35]</span> which incredibly had not killed it – everyone immediately realised this spear was definitely not European. It turned out to be a spear from a tribe in Central Africa. This was a truly defining moment in the history of ornithology because it was the first evidence that storks spend their winters in sub-Saharan Africa <span className="font-bold">[Q36]</span>. You can still see the ‘arrow stork’ in the Zoological Collection of the University of Rostock in Germany.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">People gradually became aware that European birds moved south in autumn and north in summer but didn’t know much about it until the practice of catching birds and putting rings on their legs became established. Before this, very little information was available about the actual destinations of particular species <span className="font-bold">[Q37]</span> and how they travelled there. People speculated that larger birds provided a kind of taxi service for smaller birds by carrying them on their backs. This idea came about because it seemed impossible that small birds weighing only a few grams could fly over vast oceans <span className="font-bold">[Q38]</span>. This idea was supported by observations of bird behaviour such as the harassment of larger birds by smaller birds.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">The development of bird ringing, by a Danish schoolteacher, Hans Christian Cornelius Mortensen, made many discoveries possible. This is still common practice today and relies upon what is known as ‘recovery’ <span className="font-bold">[Q39]</span> – this is when ringed birds are found dead in the place they have migrated to, and identified. Huge amounts of data were gathered in the early part of the twentieth century and for the first time in history people understood where birds actually went to in winter. In 1931, an atlas was published showing where the most common species of European birds migrated to <span className="font-bold">[Q40]</span>.</p>
