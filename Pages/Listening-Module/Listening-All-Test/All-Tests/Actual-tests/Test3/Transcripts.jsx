                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Woman:</strong> Yes.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Andrew:</strong> Hi. I rang before. My name’s Andrew. Andrew Peterson <strong className="text-blue-600">(Example)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Andrew:</strong> I rang you earlier and gave you my personal details. If you remember, I’m that student looking for work during the summer holidays.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Woman:</strong> Oh, sure. Actually, I have your file right here. But… we still need to add some further information.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yeah, that’s what they told me, and that’s why I’m ringing. What do you need to know?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Woman:</strong> Well, we have to know your main level of education. It’s a degree, I suppose.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yes, but I’m still doing it, in <strong className="text-blue-600">engineering (Q1)</strong>. It’s quite interesting.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Andrew:</strong> Some of my friends are studying computing though, so I’m interested in that, also.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Woman:</strong> Well, I’ll just write in your main degree subject. Engineering.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Woman:</strong> We usually have a demand in computing though. Have you worked with computers before?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Andrew:</strong> No. I just do some programming for fun at the university, but I almost got a job as a computer designer once.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Andrew:</strong> Actually, the only job I’ve ever had was as a <strong className="text-blue-600">car salesman (Q2)</strong>, believe it or not.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Woman:</strong> Well, at least you’ve had experience dealing with customers.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Woman:</strong> What about hobbies though? Sometimes they can help develop useful skills.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Andrew:</strong> Ummm … in my free time I don’t do much — mostly study. I play <strong className="text-blue-600">chess (Q3)</strong> occasionally at the university chess club.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Andrew:</strong> That’s right next to the tennis courts, but I’m not interested in that.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Woman:</strong> Chess helps develop analytical skills, so I’ll put that down.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Woman:</strong> Of course, it’s your main skills that employers want to know about. What would you say they are?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Andrew:</strong> Well, I’m in my third year now, studying electrical machines and generating systems, but I’d say <strong className="text-blue-600">electronics (Q4)</strong> is my best skill.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Andrew:</strong> Much better than, say, my machine skills, which aren’t so good, actually.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Woman:</strong> Okay … machine skills are in demand, but so too are electronic ones.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Woman:</strong> So we might be able to find you a part-time job in that field.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Woman:</strong> But what sort of money do you expect to get?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Andrew:</strong> Oh, anything really. I’d want the standard payment, let’s say.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Andrew:</strong> What’s normal? 1,000 a month? 1,500?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Woman:</strong> I’ll just put <strong className="text-blue-600">$1,200 (Q5)</strong>, okay?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Andrew:</strong> That’s fine by me.</p>

                </section>

                <section className="mt-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Manager:</strong> Hello everyone, and welcome to the “Fit for Life” Health Centre — a place which, as the name suggests, is not just for short-term solutions, but rather, intends to put you on a sensible and achievable looting for the rest of your life. And that’s how we’re different. For example, we could immediately put you on a harsh exercise program, expecting you to work out every day, but such a plan would see you quickly lose interest. That’s why the initial step is <span className="font-bold">a one-and-a-half-hour consultation</span> <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q11)</strong>, in which your lifestyle, current situation, and long-term goals, are all thoroughly analysed.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Manager:</strong> Now, an important part of this consultation involves analysing what you eat. There’s no point exercising here, and losing weight, then pulling it all back on, later. You will need to show <span className="font-bold">self-control and discipline in your diet</span> <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q12)</strong>, and we’ll work on that.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Manager:</strong> Similarly, we’ll put you on an exercise regime suitable for your level of fitness, so that will involve <span className="font-bold">a test</span> <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q13)</strong>, where we will take you through some activities, then measure your heart rate and blood pressure to determine how fit you are. This will be monitored during every subsequent consultation, along with your exercise schedule, and that occurs <span className="font-bold">monthly</span> <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q14)</strong>, and not half-yearly, as with many other centres.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Manager:</strong> As to our actual exercise machines and programs, you will have to decide whether it is <span className="font-bold">muscle mass, stamina, or general fitness</span> <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q15)</strong>, that you want to develop. Think about which of these three you want to target, and we’ll design a specific program for you.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Manager:</strong> Now, if you’re going to work out at this gym, you’ll need to think about your reasons for exercising. For building muscles, you’ll need our <span className="font-bold">high-stress weight units</span> <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q16)</strong>, where pumping iron is all the rage.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Manager:</strong> For beating tension, jogging is one of the best exercises, so we have ample <span className="font-bold">jogging machines</span> <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q17)</strong>, and they’re always popular.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Manager:</strong> Yoga classes help too, but don’t forget <span className="font-bold">playing squash</span> <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q18)</strong>, which, I would say, is the optimum way to improve your general well-being.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Manager:</strong> The yoga classes have a pre- and post-meeting session, so you’ll certainly meet others there. However, everyone showers, right? So, those facilities are where you’ll hear all sorts of interesting conversations, and really <span className="font-bold">get to know people</span> <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q19)</strong>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Manager:</strong> The front desk can answer all your questions, but for knowing more about a greater variety of subjects, look at <span className="font-bold">the notice board in the yoga studio</span> <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q20)</strong>, where there’s a huge array of papers, leaflets, and articles, all for you to read and consider.</p>

                        You will hear two faculty directors talking about which person in their university to promote.
                    </p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. A:</strong> Okay, we’ve got to decide who to promote to Leading Education Officer.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. B:</strong> Someone from the arts faculty, I suppose.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. A:</strong> Well, it can be from any faculty, since the position requires more general skills: handling personnel, settling disputes, and motivating them <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q21)</span> to focus on the task...</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. B:</strong> Surely computer knowledge would help. So too would knowledge in the arts.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. A:</strong> Sure, it would help, but the key criterion is being able to direct the staff appropriately.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. B:</strong> So, it doesn’t matter then from which faculty we select our candidates?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. A:</strong> Not really, but I’ve already looked at those from computing, and rejected them all.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. B:</strong> Why?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. A:</strong> They’re all too new, lacking in sufficient experience, whereas these ones from the business faculty are longtimers, so we’ll take someone from there <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q22)</span>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. B:</strong> I suppose you’re right. The arts faculty doesn’t present much in the way of suitable candidates either.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. A:</strong> But we’ll still have to train the person—teach the ropes, as they say. And he or she will have to expect to do overtime <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q23)</span>, as needed.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. B:</strong> Of course. It can get so busy that, if we were open on the weekend, they’d have to work then as well.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. A:</strong> Just as well we’re a Monday to Friday university, right?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. B:</strong> Right! But are you sure these people will actually want the job? The salary isn’t such an improvement on their current ones.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. A:</strong> I know, but there are benefits. You get overtime rates, a nice place to put your car <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q24)</span>, as well as additional petrol money if you drive for company purposes...</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. B:</strong> But those benefits are quite limited, especially given all the work and responsibility involved...</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. A:</strong> Yeah I know, but these candidates should realise that if they do this job well, there’ll be more promotions down the line <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q25)</span>. You know how everyone likes having their own office, right?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. B:</strong> Sure.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. A:</strong> Well, that would come after a few years, if they’re prepared to work hard and grow with the university.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. B:</strong> Yes, that should attract these people.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. A:</strong> Well, that’s enough talk about the job. What about the actual candidates? How many do we have?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. B:</strong> Ah, I’ve narrowed it down to four—ah, just using their first names, that’s Steven, Abdul, Lek, and Oscar. As you said, there’s quite a bit of experience between them, about 34 years in all.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. A:</strong> What’s the exact breakdown of figures?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. B:</strong> Abdul and Steven both have seven years <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q26)</span>, Lek has one more, and Oscar is the most experienced, at 12.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. A:</strong> But who’s the most qualified?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. B:</strong> Steven and Abdul have an MBA — sorry! Abdul’s got something called a M.B.P <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q27)</span>...</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. A:</strong> I’m not sure what that is, but does he do the job well?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. B:</strong> Very well, apparently...</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. A:</strong> Ah, he’s not stable <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q28)</span>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. B:</strong> Not stable at all, apparently...</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. A:</strong> What about Abdul then? Will he do?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. B:</strong> He might do, except his English language ability is limited...</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. A:</strong> In what way?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. B:</strong> His manners are okay, and he’s interested in his job, but his attitude is bad <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q29)</span>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dir. A:</strong> But with his age comes health problems <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q30)</span> as well, and serious ones at that.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">You will hear a lecturer talking about caves.</p>
                </section>

                <section className="mt-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">If there is one natural feature which has long fascinated man, it is caves — those natural underground spaces into which people can enter. No known cave in the world can exist without it being extensively explored, whether it be in remote areas, such as the Clearwater Cave in Borneo, or immensely long and difficult, such as Mammoth Cave in America, or perhaps the most challenging: those caves below the water table, full with water — in which ease the exploration is known as cave diving. Whatever the ease, if the caves are known, as complex and difficult as they usually are <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q31)</strong>, they will be explored.</p> <br />

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">The formal name for the study of caves is speleology — and involves many disciplines, such as chemistry, geology, biology, and cartography, or the science of making accurate maps, since the largest caves can be hundreds of kilometers long and highly complicated. If the exploration is just for fun, the activity is known as caving, but with the difficulties and dangers involved, the average caver is often involved with one of these speleological sciences <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q32)</strong>.</p> <br />

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">As for the number of caves in the world, research suggests that only a fraction have been found and documented, mostly in the areas in which caving has long been a popular activity, such as in America, France, or Australia. China, for example, has huge areas of limestone bedrock—prime material for cave formation—and logically must contain among the largest number of caves in the world <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q33)</strong>, yet only few are documented due to the lack of interest in caving there. Thus, as exploration continues, new caves will be discovered, and it is likely that the numbers could radically change in the future.</p> <br />

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">With caves being such mysterious and intriguing places, the obvious question concerns how they form. The most common cause is the effect of slightly acidic water in a process called ‘dissolution’. Here, water seeps into the ground, and down through rock masses. If this rock is soluble, the water dissolves some of it, and over time, the passage expands to become a cave, or cave system. The largest and most common of these involves limestone <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q34)</strong>, although other materials are possible, including gypsum, marble, and even salt.</p> <br />

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Now, if the cave is formed at the same lime as the rock, it is called a primary cave, and the most common of these are lava tubes. When lava from volcanoes flows downhill, the topmost surface cools and solidifies <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q35)</strong> first, leaving the hotter lava to continue to flow beneath. If most of this eventually flows out, a hollow tube is left. The country Iceland, has some excellent caves of this type, and even far-flung Australia has a few. Finally, there are sea caves, formed from waves pounding into coastal cliffs, and eroding into fault lines <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q36)</strong>, or softer rock. These caves are usually the shortest, about 50 meters at most, since the erosive action of the waves can only reach a certain distance.</p> <br />

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">However, it is limestone caves which will always be the most interesting. This is due to the presence of limestone formations. As the groundwater seeps downward through the ceiling of the caves, it encounters a different pressure and temperature, causing it to deposit a small amount of its dissolved calcium <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q37)</strong> carbonate. Over time, through the action of millions of drops, this deposition process results in ever-growing masses, known as stalactites (hanging from the ceiling), or stalagmites (growing from the floor). Alternatively, the water may flow over a large surface of rock, forming flowstone <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q38)</strong>, and with other sorts of processes, can result in beautiful milky-white formations of astonishing complexity.</p> <br />

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">One of the best examples of this, as well as of what surprising discoveries may yet await, is the Lechuguilla Cave in New Mexico. In the 1950s, some cavers heard the sound of wind underneath some large boulders on the cave floor, a clear sign of a deeper passageway. It took until 1984 for a group of cavers to gain permission to start digging, and two years later, in 1986 <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q39)</strong> they broke through into a walkable passageway — unlocking one of the longest cave systems in the world, the deepest in America, and some of the most beautiful formations ever found. Unusually, many of these were yellow with sulphur, suggesting that the caves were a result of hydrogen-sulfide from nearby oil deposits. This was forced through fracture lines, combining with existing groundwater to form sulfuric acid, dissolving the limestone from the bottom up <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q40)</strong>, instead of the normal top-down seepage which characterises most limestone cave formation.</p>
