                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>POLICE:</strong> Alright, just a minute while I pull up the form. OK, could you give me your first and last name?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>POLICE:</strong> Oh right, Ellendale Street: Yeah we’ve had a lot of break-ins in that area lately. And the postal code?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>ANNA:</strong> W5 2AT <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q4)</strong>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>ANNA:</strong> No.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>POLICE:</strong> Okay, what type of citizenship do you have?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>ANNA:</strong> Well, I lived in the United States for most of my life, but I am actually of Grenadian nationality.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>POLICE:</strong> Okay, so is that the country that issued your passport?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>ANNA:</strong> Yes.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>POLICE:</strong> Alright.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>POLICE:</strong> And what is the crime you are reporting?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>ANNA:</strong> I already said – a robbery!</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>POLICE:</strong> Oh, right. Sorry, this is about the hundredth robbery report I’ve filled out today. Have you had any prior break-ins?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>ANNA:</strong> Um, in the building or just my flat? The unit below mine got broken into last year.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>POLICE:</strong> No, just your flat.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>ANNA:</strong> Oh – then no <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q5)</strong>. Not here.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>POLICE:</strong> Alright, let’s see here. Can you think of anything that was out of the ordinary around your building, or anyone who may have had reason to do this?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>ANNA:</strong> No, it seemed like just a normal evening. I didn’t see anyone suspicious, and can’t think of anyone that would target me specifically.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>POLICE:</strong> How long has this been your place of residence?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>ANNA:</strong> Hm, let me think. I moved in on February 1, and it’s October, so it’s been about 8 months <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q6)</strong> already. Wow, time flies!</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>POLICE:</strong> And that is just for Ellendale, yeah?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>ANNA:</strong> Yes. I have lived in the UK for just over 1 year.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>POLICE:</strong> I see. Can you give me the first and last name of all members of the household?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>ANNA:</strong> Actually, I live alone <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q7)</strong>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>POLICE:</strong> OK – so no other occupants. And can you give me a brief account of what happened?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>ANNA:</strong> I left to go to a dinner party at 6 p.m., and when I returned at 11 I found the place ransacked and a lot of my things gone.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>POLICE:</strong> Any sign of forced entry?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>ANNA:</strong> Yes, the back door <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q8)</strong> was wide open, and it looked like someone used a crowbar to force it open.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>POLICE:</strong> I see. And just to be clear, was the door locked when you left?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>ANNA:</strong> Of course!</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>POLICE:</strong> Hey, you would be surprised how many reports we get where people have failed to lock their doors. Now I need you to list any missing items valued above £200.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>ANNA:</strong> So far I’m missing my computer, my purse with my wallet in it, and the TV.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>POLICE:</strong> OK. Let’s start with the computer. What is the estimated value?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>ANNA:</strong> £500.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>POLICE:</strong> And what is the serial number?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>ANNA:</strong> G4168770 <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q9)</strong>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>POLICE:</strong> Thank you, and a visual description?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>ANNA:</strong> It is a black 13-inch Pemdas Cloudbook. There is an Oxford sticker on the lid.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>POLICE:</strong> OK, and could you give a description of the purse?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>ANNA:</strong> Sure. It’s a Claude Frieda shoulder bag and the material is silver-colored cloth <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q10)</strong>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>POLICE:</strong> Price?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>ANNA:</strong> £300.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>POLICE:</strong> Okay. That concludes my report. I’ll submit it and we’ll let you know of any developments.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Hi, Mark. Hi, Gina. What can I help you with?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>MARK:</strong> So we were hoping you could help us with this extracurricular project.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Sure – what is the topic?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>GINA:</strong> Attending business school.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> This sounds like a great idea. So you’re going to explain the requirements for getting into business school?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>MARK:</strong> Not exactly. It will be more broadly about the experience – the academics, accommodation, and social experience that comes with being a part of the business school <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q11)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> I see. So would your audience be the general public?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>GINA:</strong> Well, we would probably want more to focus on members of the institution – we would especially like to reach individual applicants to the business school <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q12)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> I see. Now what form will this information be? You could give a talk to all the summer courses – all you would need is permission from the course director. Or you could pass out information outside the student union.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>MARK:</strong> Those are both good ideas. What about sending out pamphlets in the mail?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Most college students never check their mail. Maybe you could make a video and show it on campus?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>GINA:</strong> That’s a great idea. We’ll do the video <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q13)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Great. And as members of the business school, do you have an incentive to attract new students? If so, this idea is a great way to do that.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>MARK:</strong> No, the idea actually came about because of how much students like us worry about their studies <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q14)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>GINA:</strong> Yeah – when I got into business school, there were a lot of things I had not prepared for, so the video would cover a lot of things Mark and I wish we had known upon entering business school.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Right.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> What would you talk about first?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>MARK:</strong> The first and probably most important section would be academics.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Good idea. So would you provide guidance on what courses to take?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>GINA:</strong> We want to focus especially on the approaches professors take – their teaching methods <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q15)</strong>. It is far different than what students are used to in high school, and even in liberal arts college.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Good idea. And how long do you think you would spend explaining academics?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>MARK:</strong> We’ll probably spend 7 minutes on it.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>GINA:</strong> We also have some ideas for talking about housing, food options, and stuff like that. We’re not really sure how to tie it all together though.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> I think it would be suitable to title that section accommodation <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q16)</strong> – what do you think?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>MARK:</strong> That could work. We’ll definitely describe the different dining options at the cafeteria, and then walk students through flats and the grueling process of finding one near the business school campus.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>GINA:</strong> Okay – so we would cover specifics on the cafeteria, as well as flats <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q17)</strong>?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>MARK:</strong> I think those are both helpful. We could spend about 6 minutes on accommodation, and be sure to touch on those specifically.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Great. Is there anything else you would talk about?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>GINA:</strong> We definitely want to go over the social aspect of attending school here.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Of course. I think it’s good to have a little fun once in a while when you’re working so hard in school.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>MARK:</strong> I think we are going to introduce new students to the disco <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q18)</strong> that so many upperclassmen know and love. Maybe we’ll include a few other places too, but that’s the main one.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>GINA:</strong> We’re also going to invite students to the international evening <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q19)</strong> taking place in the first week of school as a great chance for our large international student population to meet a lot of other new students.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> It can definitely be hard to meet people as an international student. I think that is a great idea. You may want to spend slightly longer on this section than the other two.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>MARK:</strong> Hm… How about 8 minutes?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>GINA:</strong> That sounds reasonable. So overall, the introduction should take 3 minutes, and then the conclusion should take 4, giving us a total of 28 minutes.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> I wouldn’t rush your introduction. Maybe give it between 4 and 6 minutes. The conclusion, though, can be shorter since it’s just a quick refresher of each of the topics. Give that not more than 2 minutes <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q20)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>MARK:</strong> Okay. So in total the video should take about the same time, just more intro and less conclusion?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Precisely.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>GINA:</strong> Alright – we are going to get to work on our video. Thanks for your help!</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DANI:</strong> So tell me about your research project, John.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JOHN:</strong> I created a questionnaire for the study to determine people’s opinions of the relative feasibility of earning a living in Brisbane <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q21)</span>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DANI:</strong> Oh, cool. How is it scored? Are they all multiple choice questions?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JOHN:</strong> Well, the questions consist primarily of yes/no responses. There are two free response questions at the end. Participants will use a computer to fill in their answers <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q22)</span>; that way it is really easy to analyse the data afterward.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DANI:</strong> Great! It sounds like you have a pretty solid idea of what you should do. Just don’t forget to submit a copy of your plans to Professor Curran by the 15th.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JOHN:</strong> Oh, I almost forgot!</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DANI:</strong> Hm, you don’t do it for high grade or appraise, but he can review and give you feedback <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q23)</span>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JOHN:</strong> Right, that will be helpful – he has been conducting studies like this for 30 years now.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DANI:</strong> Yep, oh and I’m curious – are you going to be in the room giving subjects directions for the questionnaire?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JOHN:</strong> Well, I think the instructions will be provided by another representative who will not be analysing the data <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q24)</span>. I want them to feel they can answer and be completely anonymous, so I will not be in the room. Anonymity is really important for this study.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DANI:</strong> I agree. Good idea. You should tell the representative to remind subjects to fully consider both sides of each issue <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q25)</span>. Sometimes it’s really easy to immediately check “yes” or “no” without stopping to think about it completely.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JOHN:</strong> That’s so true! It’s like a race to finish the questionnaire first or something. I’ll make sure to include that in the instructions. This report has to be perfect!</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DANI:</strong> Wow, what’s the big deal? I know it’s part of your grade and all…</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JOHN:</strong> Well it’s that, but also a well-executed study could grab the attention of faculty in the department, which would be a huge deal.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DANI:</strong> So…for attention?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JOHN:</strong> No silly! I mean I could really gain the respect of professors who may later take me on as a graduate student in their labs <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q26)</span>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DANI:</strong> Oh, I see.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DANI:</strong> Let me take a look at the survey. Wow, this looks great! The map of the median income by region is a great tool – where did you find it? <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q27)</span></p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JOHN:</strong> Well thanks! I read a lot of sources and just noticed this one in a small psychology journal called Modern Psychology <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q27)</span>. It’s more helpful than the photo I added, but I think the photo is just so interesting. It was in the newspaper last year during that huge wage strike <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q28)</span>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DANI:</strong> It’s great. Probably not necessary, but it looks great. I don’t understand – what is WKRX’s involvement here?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JOHN:</strong> Oh – the radio station agreed to sponsor the study if I play their station in the room <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q29)</span>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DANI:</strong> Wow, interesting. So you don’t have to pay for any of this?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JOHN:</strong> Exactly.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DANI:</strong> Nice! Where did you get that idea?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JOHN:</strong> Last month at the Psychology Club Council meeting someone talked about how easy it is to get sponsorship from local businesses, so I listened to their advice and called around! <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q30)</span></p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DANI:</strong> I’ll have to remember that. Well, this all looks great. Good luck!</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>LECTURER:</strong> Good afternoon. In the last few lectures we’ve been covering the social and political pressures that influenced the rise of the rebellion of 1679. Today I would like to focus on the Pleasanton Town Market.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Now, why are we talking all about some market? It’s not like it was the first market ever, or even a particularly large market. The Pleasanton Town Market is important because it is often mentioned in the literature found in the library <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q31)</strong>. If you have ever been there, you have probably seen all of the handcrafted items sold there now. But what was originally bought and sold in the town market?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">In the beginning, the market sold products such as meats, furs, and simple tools. Over time, though, it became known as the place to find quality livestock <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q32)</strong>. People came from all over the world to find the biggest and best cows, pigs, and chickens. In fact, the profits from the Town Market became the savior of a plummeting economy during a time of much turmoil. Not to be confused with the reconstruction era, a period of rapid development came about in the 1660s as a result of the market’s vendors contributing their profits to building up much needed public facilities and defense <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q33)</strong>, which would later make a huge impact on the outcome of the war.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">For many years, the market flourished and began to draw in large tourism crowds in addition to the throngs of livestock customers. However, as revolutions in farming came about, more people moved to farms far from the city centre. Customers grew more and more reluctant to travel all the way to the town centre for their meats when they could easily choose to buy from local farmers near them for a fraction of the price <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q34)</strong>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">With such a fall in the profits of the town’s major profit generator, some quality town planning was needed. In the mayoral election of 1668, a young man of little fame just barely claimed the popular vote – none other than the now legendary John C. Wiley.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Wiley’s first decision as mayor of Pleasanton was to deal with the quickly failing Town Market. The building with the large clock was a landmark that had symbolised growth in Pleasanton for a generation. Wiley decided to use the notoriety of the Town Market to set an example. During the historical Rotterdam Rebellion, Wiley gave all those involved lifetime prison sentences in the very same building <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q35)</strong>. It stayed a prison for about 50 more years until they transported all remaining prisoners to other facilities and turned it into the historical monument today.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Now that you know the basics of the history of the Pleasanton Town Market, I will introduce your next group project. I want you, to make a short film based on the real historical events that occurred in Pleasanton before and during the uprising.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">I will give you some class time to look through the library’s reference section, but you will be responsible for conducting further research outside of class. I suggest starting by looking for information on the market <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q36)</strong> itself. You’ll find plenty of information – in fact, some students complain that there is actually too much information on it.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">On your own time, you could find family members of old war veterans to conduct interviews <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q37)</strong>. Sometimes they provide wonderful insight that you wouldn’t find in proper history books, but be careful – an interview that is riddled with bias is useless <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q38)</strong>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">I myself have some very old photographs <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q39)</strong> here that you are welcome to take a look at for some inspiration. I’m lucky enough to own this one of Jim Wiley himself! Very interesting to see, but does not provide enough information to add much to your film.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Feel free to take this film into whatever direction you choose; You could even do a crime <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q40)</strong> thriller based on real outlaws. All you would have to do is look through the newspaper archives in the crime section during that time period. Try to get as much detail as you can, but you may end up having to draw your own conclusions.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Okay, that’s enough from me, so let’s go on to…</p>
