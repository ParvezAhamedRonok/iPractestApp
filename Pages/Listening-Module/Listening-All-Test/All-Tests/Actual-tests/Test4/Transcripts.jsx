                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Rep.:</strong> Hello. I’m a representative of the Tallyho Survey Company, and I’d like to ask you a few questions regarding <strong className="text-blue-600">exercise (Example)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Person:</strong> Oh, that’s an interesting subject.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Rep.:</strong> Yes, we think so, too.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Person:</strong> But I’m afraid I’m a bit busy at the moment.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Rep.:</strong> Don’t worry. This will only take about four minutes at the most. It’s <strong className="text-blue-600">10:25 (Q1)</strong> now, so it will all be over by 10:30.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Person:</strong> Well … alright, if it’s that short.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Rep.:</strong> It will be. So, one of the first things I need to know is where you are — that is, which suburb or area of the city? The last client was in Blackburn, for example.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Person:</strong> Blackburn. That’s close to me. I’m in <strong className="text-blue-600">Box Hill (Q2)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Rep.:</strong> Another eastern suburb then. I have a friend in Box Hill, too. Interesting place. Now, I need your approximate age for this survey. Are you younger than 20, between 20 and 29, 30 and 39, and so on?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Person:</strong> I’ll turn 40 in a few months, so that puts me in the 40 to 49 age group.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Rep.:</strong> Well, that’s in a few months, so right now you’re in the <strong className="text-blue-600">30 to 39 (Q3)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Person:</strong> Oh, right. So put that then.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Rep.:</strong> Okay. Now, I need to know your occupation. The last caller was a housewife, for example; the one before that a teacher.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Person:</strong> I used to be a teacher, too, teaching cookery.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Rep.:</strong> And now?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Person:</strong> Now you can just put <strong className="text-blue-600">‘domestic duties (Q4)’</strong>. Actually, I hope to begin a new job soon, as a cook, but that won’t be for some time yet. I have to wait for my husband’s restaurant to open.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Rep.:</strong> Cook? That sounds interesting, but it’s ‘domestic duties’ for now. Okay, that just leaves some information about your family. This is not obligatory at all, so if you don’t want to answer, that’s fine.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Person:</strong> What sort of information, exactly?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Rep.:</strong> Oh, it’s very broad. Married, with children; single mother, that sort of thing. The last customer said she was a single mother.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Person:</strong> I’m married, and not a mother. Put <strong className="text-blue-600">‘married, no children (Q5)’</strong>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">You will hear the director of a language-centre library explaining about its facilities to some new students.</p>
                </section>

                <section className="mt-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Welcome to the library, or the I.L.C., which means Independent Learning Centre, and let me explain about some of its facilities. We’re standing here at the entry gates, next to the borrowing desk. That’s where you check out any books, but you are also advised to study in the library here, since most of our material cannot be borrowed. Thus, we have seating along the middle of the library, and in that far corner in front of us, on the left, we have the Quiet Reading Section <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q11)</strong>, for some serious reading activity.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">We used to have the computers there but then realised that that corner was very quiet, and thus better suited for the purpose it now has. The computers were instead shifted to a more central location, right beside us here, on the left <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q12)</strong>. Again, somewhat confusingly, this area once housed the Newspaper and Magazine Section, but the people in the Quiet Reading Area had to walk too far to collect this literature, so it was moved to right beside them, in the adjacent corner <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q13)</strong>. So, feel free to read the newspapers there. But the reference books, those huge weighty dictionaries, atlases, and encyclopedias, were all situated at the opposite end of the building, against the wall <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q14)</strong>. This was because they weren’t generally that popular, and we wanted more space for the magazine racks, always a favourite with readers.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Okay, as well as reading, you need to work on your listening skills, and for that you need the Audio Section. Again, such an activity needs a quiet area, so we put this in the last remaining corner, up there on your right, as you can see <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q15)</strong>. There are CD players and headphones, so just borrow the listening packs, sit down there, and listen away.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Right, that just leaves the main library. In other libraries, that’s often right beside the Newspaper and Magazine Section, allowing freedom to choose from all genres of literature, but here, we’ve got them further apart. For the main library, just follow your nose, past the central seating there, and it’s there among all that shelving <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q16)</strong>, upon which you’ll find an abundance of interesting books and listening packs to use.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Now, I’d like to tell you a bit more about an excellent service offered in the I.L.C. here that we call the ‘Special Sessions’. What can you do in them? For a start, many of you need practice in speaking English, and for that we hold a special Discussion Session, led by a teacher. That can be noisy, in fact, we hope that it is noisy, since that would mean many people are talking. It’s in the Central Seating area, and it used to be from 10:30 to 1:30, but we found that the noise was disturbing the regular I.L.C patrons, so we shortened and moved this discussion to the morning, 9:00 am time slot <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q17)</strong>, when fewer people are in the centre. It goes for one and a half hours.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Alright, what about Writing Skills? Well, we can help you there with another teacher. Now, writing is a fairly quiet activity, so that teacher stations him or herself in the Quiet Reading area from 1:30 until three <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q18)</strong>. The 10:30-to-midday time slot cannot have a teacher for such writing skills, as they are all teaching in the morning. For this reason, of course, there cannot be an on-call teacher in the morning either, although many people would like one, particularly the 10:30-to-noon crowd, having just finished their early morning class. These students all have to wait until midday onwards, when, for three hours, a teacher will be stationed in the Audio Section <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q19)</strong>, ready to deal with all those questions.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Until recently, we had another teacher doing the 3:00 pm to 6:00 pm time slot, in the Central Seating, but all the noise interfered with the late users of the I.L.C., so we had to cancel that. Also noisy can be the Language Exchange, where local students who want to learn your language will help you practise English. This is generally done in pairs, so the noise level is low enough not to need this exchange to run at 9:00 am, but at a more congenial time of 10:30, among the Central Seating <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q20)</strong>. That must finish by 1:30 though, after which quieter and more individual activities take place.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dylan:</strong> Hi, Emily. What did you think of that lecture?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Emily:</strong> A bit hard to follow, but I have some good lecture-listening note-taking strategies which really help, so I can review the lecturer’s message later.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dylan:</strong> Lecture-listening note-taking strategies? Review it later? That sounds interesting. I must admit, I struggle a bit to take down the gist of what I hear. Look at my notes.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Emily:</strong> Well, I can see a basic problem immediately. You’re writing full words, such as ‘century’ when all you need is a ‘C’. And don’t write ‘increase’; just draw an ‘up’ arrow. And why write ‘thousand’ when a ‘th’ will do?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dylan:</strong> I see. Just use symbols <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q21)</span>. That’s not a bad idea at all.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Emily:</strong> It’s the most basic strategy, allowing you to record information at a faster pace. These lecturers can talk faster than others, too, so you don’t want to waste any time. But you need to be very familiar with your set of symbols.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dylan:</strong> Why?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Emily:</strong> Because you’ll have to look at these notes days, weeks, or even months afterwards, when you begin writing your essay, so you’ll need to be able to interpret <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q22)</span> them at a later stage.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dylan:</strong> I think I can do this, even by looking at your notes. ‘Immed’ must mean immediately.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Emily:</strong> But regarding the lecture as a whole, I knew the professor would be giving a set of specific recommendations, and comparing two alternative approaches, so I formatted my page in advance, adding the features consistent with the nature <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q23)</span> of what I was going to hear.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dylan:</strong> Ah … I think I need an example of what you mean.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Emily:</strong> Well, look at my page. Before the lecture, I drew large headings <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q24)</span> saying ‘recommendations’. You should always draw these, and I drew a table saying, ‘Approach 1’ and ‘Approach 2’. At the end I drew a flowchart, as obviously the final recommendation would be a step-by-step approach. Then I was prepared in advance to simply fill in the spaces.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dylan:</strong> Wow! Now that’s clever.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dylan:</strong> Your advice about note-taking sounds great, but I still have one question, Emily. How are you able to design your page in advance? I mean, how can you predict the nature of the talk, and know which design is likely to work best?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Emily:</strong> It’s rather obvious when you think about it. What’s your next lecture about?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dylan:</strong> Legal Studies <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q25)</span>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Emily:</strong> Well, that suggests to me that you’ll need a flowchart, since the judicial system has a very logical ‘do this first, do that second’ approach, which must be followed in that order—y’know, all the processes that happen in the courtroom, and the procedures <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q26)</span> that must take place to ensure complete legality.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dylan:</strong> Sure. That’s the way law is, very linear and orderly, but what about Culture Studies? That’s just a mass of comparisons of different cultures.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Emily:</strong> Which tells you that you will need a table, where, in tabular form, you can efficiently write down information.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dylan:</strong> But often the lecture’s not that simple. The professor throws in a really complex mix of ideas.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Emily:</strong> Then use a spider graph—like the web a spider makes, where there’s a central idea around which you attach all the associated <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q27)</span> thoughts, and ideas, and impressions.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dylan:</strong> I see. I think I understand. And that would be very quick, too; very efficient. I like that. But what about Management Theory? How would you approach that?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Emily:</strong> The same as with Culture Studies. I’d use a network, which is basically the same as a spider graph, linking thoughts, although this time there are directions <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q28)</span> involved.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dylan:</strong> Okay … has directions. It sounds logical. And what about the other subjects, such as Political Science?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Emily:</strong> Well, for that I’d just put my notes <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q29)</span> in a line.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Dylan:</strong> Okay, that just leaves Mass Media.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Emily:</strong> For that, I wouldn’t have any special design at all. The best you can do is pre-write headings <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q30)</span>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">You will hear a lecturer talking about an unusual atomic particle, called the neutrino.</p>
                </section>

                <section className="mt-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">When considering the smallest unit of matter—the atom — most people know of electrons, protons, and neutrons, but almost none know of another particle, even though they are constantly emitted from the sun in the trillions, with 100 to 200 billion <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q31)</strong> of them regularly passing through your body every second. To repeat, that’s not thousands, not millions, but billions, every second. You don’t feel them because they are small, in fact, so tiny that we can barely detect their presence at all. These mysterious particles are called neutrinos.</p> <br />

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Despite such an abundance, detecting them is a huge undertaking, and there are many reasons for this. Firstly, the neutrino itself is so small that you need to eliminate absolutely all other particles around. To do this, you need what is called a clean room <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q32)</strong>, one that has an extremely low level of dust, microbes, floating particles, or chemical vapours. You probably don’t know it, but the air around you right now has almost 40 million particles per cubic meter. In contrast, the cleanest of clean rooms has less than 10.</p> <br />

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">The second problem is that you also need an environment with absolutely no background radiation <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q33)</strong>. At the surface of the Earth, such radiation is all around, from the sun and sky, and from TVs and communication devices. The only way to screen out all that is to go underground, and I mean deep underground <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q34)</strong>. For example, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in Canada uses an old nickel mine, one of the deepest in the world, and puts the Observatory in its lowest tunnel, more than two kilometers below the surface. At such depths, stray radiation is sufficiently screened out to allow neutrinos only to pass by.</p> <br />

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">The final problem is that you need an elaborate detection system, and this apparatus is huge, and its installation in this deep underground cavity presents quite a headache. Holding such a weighty construction safe and secure requires complex <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q35)</strong> engineering work, such as rock-bolting and support structuring. This obviously requires great care, and takes a lot of effort.</p> <br />

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">So, I’ve told you about the difficulty in detecting neutrinos. They are tiny, virtually weightless, have no electric charge, and hardly interact with anything at all. Yet we can detect them, and to see how, let’s consider the Sudbury installation once again. The detector there consists of a spherical container filled with heavy water <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q36)</strong>. This rests inside another vessel filled with normal water, which helps support the weight of the inner sphere, as well as providing further shielding from any stray radiation. At the edge of this inner sphere are about 10,000 electronic <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q37)</strong> detectors. These are extremely sensitive, able to multiply a hundred million times any electric current which occurs.</p> <br />

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">So, as the neutrinos pass through this sphere of water, there is a very very very small chance that one of them may hit a water molecule. To increase the likelihood of this, two strategies are used. One, the larger the sphere of water, the better, and the Sudbury tank holds not 10 tons, not 100 tons, but 1000 tons <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q38)</strong>. Two, the water is special, consisting as it does of heavier molecules. So, what happens is this. If the neutrino hits the water molecule, the neutrino is absorbed, but the molecule itself splits apart, producing a tiny electric current <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q39)</strong>. It is this which is detected, and analysed, giving key information about the neutrino.</p> <br />

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">The final question is why do we care about these elusive particles? Well, just think — they can pass right through the core of our sun at the speed of light without being affected or losing strength. No other form of radiation can do that, meaning that the knowledge we get about neutrinos can help us to control <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q40)</strong> them.
