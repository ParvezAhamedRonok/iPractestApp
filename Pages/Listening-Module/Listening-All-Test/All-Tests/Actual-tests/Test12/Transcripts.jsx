                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> Hello, Elite Travel, this is Emily speaking, how may I assist you today?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CUSTOMER:</strong> Hi, I have a group visit to plan, and I wonder whether you could help me decide on which hotel to book. I have narrowed it down to either the Winchester, the Royal Hotel, or the Star Hotel. I am wondering if you have a recommendation.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> I would be happy to help! Those three are excellent choices. If everyone is booking hotel rooms independently, an easy way to do it is online booking. The Star Hotel offers online bookings at no additional charge.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CUSTOMER:</strong> It sounds fine!</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> Yeah, and you can even book the gorgeous sea view rooms <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q1)</strong> if you act quickly.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CUSTOMER:</strong> Hm, I will consider that. It would be great since we are mostly first-time visitors to the area to get a nice view of the water. Now, are there handicap accessible rooms?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> Yes, all three options have access for the physically disabled <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q2)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CUSTOMER:</strong> Great. I should also mention that we will be on a tight schedule, so we won’t have much time to go out for meals. Which of these hotels serve food?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> There is a limited continental breakfast menu at the Star and at the Winchester. For a full restaurant and room service, the Royal Hotel is your best bet <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q3)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CUSTOMER:</strong> Oh wonderful! Could you tell me more about the restaurant?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> Absolutely. In the morning there is a gourmet buffet or a la carte item, and after 11 a.m. lunch is served in the dining room. Dinners are in a nice, low-key but high-quality setting in the hotel’s private dining room <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q4)</strong> and Fridays feature the house jazz band.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CUSTOMER:</strong> How lovely! Is there a group discount?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> No, sorry. Not at the Royal hotel. Let me check on the others, though. Could I place you on hold for just a second?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CUSTOMER:</strong> Sure, thanks.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> It looks like there is one at the Winchester – 15% off when you book 8 or more rooms <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q5)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CUSTOMER:</strong> Really? Sold! We’ll book at the Winchester. Wait – is it suitable for children though? We’ll have a few little ones in our group, and it would be great to have a way to keep them occupied.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> Yes. In fact, it has a play place <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q6)</strong> that kids just love, with slides, and swings and everything. Definitely a good hotel to bring the kids.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CUSTOMER:</strong> Okay, great.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CUSTOMER:</strong> So now I know where we’ll be staying, what next? Should I go ahead and book transportation and assign rooms and everything?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> Well, for now, there are only a few things for you to take care of. We will hold a block of rooms for you as soon as you send a deposit <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q7)</strong>. I recommend booking as soon as possible, so you probably want to send the invitations <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q8)</strong> as soon as you know how many rooms to hold.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CUSTOMER:</strong> Oh, right. Okay, I’ll send the invitations and put down the deposit. Is there anything else I should take care of?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> Great! And don’t worry about this now, but sometime before you arrive do let us know if you’ll be requiring our transport <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q9)</strong> service to and from the airport.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CUSTOMER:</strong> I’ll make sure to let you know. Does that incur a service charge? Or perhaps a tip, or some presents to show our gratitude for the personal car service?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> Oh, don’t worry about it. It is a free service, so if you would like to tip you are welcome to do so, but hotel drivers do not accept gifts <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q10)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>CUSTOMER:</strong> Thanks for your help!</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> My pleasure. Enjoy your stay at the Winchester!</p>

Take it from me – you won’t want to miss Durham’s most attended public event of the year 5 times running. You don’t have to be a motor head to appreciate the finest cars both new and old in existence today, but it helps! Be one of the 70,000 <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q12)</strong> people to see everything from big rig monster trucks to good old fashion classic hot rods.</p>

You’ll see me – Skip Gordon – and all your friends from WKXP there this Sunday at our very own booth, so stop by and say hi and you might just win a prize of your own.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">A new attraction this year will be the addition of a new car category – electricity <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q15)</strong>, namely the electric car class. See displays from Toyota, Honda, and – you guessed it – Tesla! Watch as the first generation of fully electric cars compete on style, ride, and watch the main entertainment as there’s going to be a fabulous show of racing car <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q16)</strong> to see who takes home fastest battery powered car. While not typically known for their speed, this new class is guaranteed to surprise you.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Get tickets before they sell out! Last year’s tickets sold out fast, so we upped the attendance this year. That’s right, more seats!

Meanwhile Mom and Dad can take a spin in a ride a bit more than their size. We’re rolling out a massive dirt track so you can get behind the wheel and test drive something a little more adventurous. Put the pedal to the metal in a 4 by 4 SUV <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q19)</strong> as you go over bumps and navigate through twists and turns – you’ll want to buckle up!</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">You heard it here – act now to get in on the fun at thé Durham County Car Show before it’s too late. Come for prizes, good prices, and good old fashioned family fun. We had a lucky draw for a NEW car last year <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q20)</strong>, but this year our main event is the Monster Truck Rally, where one lucky fan will win a chance experience the thrill from behind the wheel – well, next to the wheel as they ride with legendary driver Smash Tate!

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Hi, Professor Jamison, I was hoping we could talk this week about choosing courses for next semester.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> That sounds great! Any idea yet what you would like to take?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Well, I was hoping you could kind of tell me. There are so many to choose from. I don’t even know where to start!</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Sure. Well, first thing’s first. Do you know what you will major in? It is important to take courses that are relevant to your career path <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q21)</span>.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Well, I think I want to major in Biology. I want to go to medical school, so it seems like it would make sense.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> I agree – if you like Biology, it is definitely a good idea to focus on that since so many of the requirements overlap.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Okay, so I should take a few Biology classes then?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Yes. Let’s start there. You should pick one or two Biology classes. Not just any Biology classes, though! If possible, read online or talk to senior fellows and find out about the structure of the courses <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q22)</span>. You don’t want to end up signing up for two classes that require labs in the same semester – you’ll spend so much time in the Biology Department that you won’t see the light of day.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Oh right, good idea. I heard labs can be as long as 4 hours.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> That is true. And another thing – make sure the topic is either relevant to your major, or something you are interested in learning about <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q23)</span>. It sounds obvious, but do not just take a class because you heard it was easy, or because it does not require attendance.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Of course not. Though it would be really nice to have at least one class, that’s a little bit less rigorous than the ones I’m taking this semester. I barely sleep as it is with all this studying.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> That may have more to do with your study habits, though I don’t disagree that your schedule is really difficult this semester.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> So any idea which Biology classes you may decide on for next semester?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Well, I was thinking of taking Human Physiology – it sounds relevant and interesting.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> I think it is an interesting class, but I would recommend against it. You are already in Human Anatomy, which also covers Physiology so it would be repetitive, and probably not the best use of your time <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q24)</span>.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> If I already know some of the stuff, I could take it to boost my GPA a little bit.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Um, you could maybe do that, except the professor that teaches it is famous for giving out the fewest A’s of any professor.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Oh wow. Never mind.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Now, changing subjects, have you decided yet on your research topic?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Well, I actually decided. I don’t want to do a research paper. I’m going to do a dissertation instead. I think I will much more enjoy coming up with a thesis and finding all the details to support it <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q25)</span>.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> I see. Didn’t you already do some of the research though? What happened to that?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Well, I started doing research. Then the more data I collected, the more complicated things got <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q26)</span>. I realised I would have to take a lot more steps to randomise the sample, and then I realised I would need to control for more factors.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> I see. What kind of data collection did you do?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> I interviewed employees at the water treatment facility after Professor Dickinson recommended it <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q27)</span>.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> I understand. Well, the research paper could be much more outside work, but it may be worth it if that is what you are interested in.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> No, I am a lot happier just doing the dissertation.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> That’s fine with me. Just remember, you need to finish your first draft and send it in soon. It’s already the middle of February!</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Oh wow, it is, isn’t it? I just have to finish it by the end of March <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q28)</span>, right?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Yep, but don’t forget! The date will really sneak up on you.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> OK, I’ll make sure to set reminders in my calendar. And who do I talk to about registering my dissertation?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> You should go to the Department Office, and then talk to the secretary <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q29)</span>.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> I thought I needed to talk to the Department Head.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Not for registering. If you need help developing your dissertation, that’s when you should go to the Department Head.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Oh, I see. And who would I see about getting access to the database of past research on my topic?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> That you can find in the computer <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q30)</span> lab, specifically in the office – you’ll have to ask a lab technician to give you access.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Okay. Well, I’ll go ahead and get started on that then. Thanks!</p>

                        Good morning, everyone. In today’s lecture, I’m going to talk about the role of sleep in humans and animals. Of all the biological processes in the animal kingdom, sleep is perhaps the most important. A human can survive for almost two weeks without eating, but did you know that one week without sleep can be fatal? It’s even worse for animals, especially for those who must avoid predators. Without sleep, an animal is much less capable of avoiding an attack <strong className="font-bold text-blue-600">(Q31)</strong> – this is the case for all animals, whether they are reptiles, mammals <strong className="font-bold text-blue-600">(Q32)</strong> or fish. Let us look now at how different animals sleep, reasons for their ways of rest, and the potential problems they might encounter.

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
                        In marine life, sleep must be balanced with breathing. For example, the dolphin must float to the surface as it sleeps in order to breathe <strong className="font-bold text-blue-600">(Q33)</strong>. Like other large sea mammals, they keep one eye open and one half of the brain awake at all times to maintain some amount of consciousness required to breathe and to watch out for possible threats. They sleep with only one brain hemisphere in slow-wave sleep.

                        Birds also have unusual sleeping patterns, mostly due to being constantly on edge <strong className="font-bold text-blue-600">(Q34)</strong> in the presence of numerous predators. They usually sleep quite lightly -for example, Swainson’s Thrush, also called Olive-backed Thrush, is a medium-sized thrush that takes hundreds of naps during the day, each of which lasts just a few seconds. While migrating, migratory birds tend to function well on micronaps.

                        Horses, on the other hand, do most of their sleeping standing up. Scientists think that horses develop their habit of sleeping upright as a defense mechanism, a way of protecting themselves against predators, and a standing position keeps a horse in a constant state of readiness to race away if danger should approach.

                        Also, horses do occasionally take short naps lying down. Horses are heavy animals with big muscles, but their bones <strong className="font-bold text-blue-600">(Q35)</strong> are surprisingly delicate, so lying in one position for a long time could well injure a horse. Just like humans, animals can also have sleeping problems <strong className="font-bold text-blue-600">(Q36)</strong>. Dr. John Hedricks and Adrian Morrison from the School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, determined that certain diseases were primarily associated with the sleep states in animals. In their research they emphasised that because so much in this area still remains unclear, animal models were very important for studies of sleep disorders. The physiology of sleep in animals is similar to that of humans.

                        But why do we humans sleep? Researchers and scientists believe it helps us organise our memories <strong className="font-bold text-blue-600">(Q37)</strong> of the day – that sleep acts as a kind of filing system for the brain. Without it, our thoughts become disorderly and confused, which leads to increased likelihood of accidents and a tendency to say and do bizarre things. Researchers also believe that sleep plays a key role in learning <strong className="font-bold text-blue-600">(Q38)</strong>. We sleep so that the brain can integrate new knowledge and form new associations. Because of the similar sleeping pattern to that of humans, rats <strong className="font-bold text-blue-600">(Q39)</strong> are often studied in order to increase our knowledge of human physiology. In one study, rats were kept awake for almost two weeks, and their behavior was observed. Researchers found the sleep-deprived rats could hardly remember anything of what they had been taught that day. For example, one rat had been taught to recognise pictures of various Parisian landmarks in order to receive food – pressing a button below a picture of the Louvre would result in food being released and so forth. However, when deprived of sleep, they would press buttons seemingly at random.

                        In addition to rats, the fruit fly, a small insect that feeds and breeds on spoiled fruit, also has been used as a model organism and thousands of scientists around the world work on it. But why was the fruit fly chosen to be studied? It was for practical reasons. The most important one is that the relationship between fly and human genes is so close that the sequences of newly discovered human genes, including genes that show a susceptibility, can often be matched against their fly counterparts. This provides an indication of the function of the human gene and could help in the development of effective drugs to help people with sleeping disorders. Therefore, many scientists today choose to study the genetic structure <strong className="font-bold text-blue-600">(Q40)</strong> of the fruit fly, which could make a particularly important contribution to the understanding of developmental processes in humans.

                        In conclusion, sleep is a necessary part of life not just for humans, but for the entire animal kingdom. Now, I’d be happy to answer any questions you may have…
