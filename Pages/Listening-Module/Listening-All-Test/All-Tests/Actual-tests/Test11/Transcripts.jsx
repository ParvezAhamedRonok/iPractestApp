                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> Yes, I’d like to speak with Janet Evans <strong className="text-blue-600">(Example)</strong>, please.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JANET:</strong> Speaking.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> Hi Ms. Evans, this is Jim Rodriguez calling from Farrelly Mutual about your recent homeowner’s insurance inquiry.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JANET:</strong> Yes, hi. Thanks for returning my call.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> My pleasure. I understand you are potentially interested in insurance for a bungalow located a bit out of town. Could you give me the address?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JANET:</strong> Sure, it’s 49 Greenway <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q1)</strong> Court. Greenway is one word.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> Thank you. Alright, and would you prefer to be contacted via email or phone?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JANET:</strong> Either one is fine – maybe try emailing me first and as an alternative I can give you my phone number.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> Great – and what is your email address?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JANET:</strong> pk2@cat.com <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q2)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> Hm, did you say “cat,” as in the animal?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JANET:</strong> Yes. It is the acronym for the construction company I work for – I’m sure you’ve seen them around.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> Yes, I have. And could you give me your primary phone number, and the best time to reach you?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JANET:</strong> Sure – the number is (020) 4251-9443. I am generally unable to answer my phone at work, but anytime after 5.30 p.m. <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q3)</strong> is fine.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> I will make a note of that here. Now I’m going to ask you a little bit about the property itself so we can make an accurate estimate of the cost of insuring your home. Could you tell me the size of your house?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JANET:</strong> Um, well, I don’t have the exact measurements, but I’m pretty sure it’s right around 80 <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q4)</strong> square metres.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> And what material is your house made of?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JANET:</strong> It’s mainly brick <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q5)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> And do you have any sort of home security, Ms. Evans?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JANET:</strong> We have an alarm system <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q6)</strong> that we use regularly.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> Good. Now I’ll go through a number of things we offer coverage for...</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JANET:</strong> I think I’d just like the contents of the house to be covered against theft then.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> Would you like flood insurance?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JANET:</strong> Yes – I definitely want flood <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q7)</strong> coverage.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> It looks like your annual insurance rate will be £148.30 <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q8)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JANET:</strong> Thanks, that seems reasonable. How long does it take to begin receiving coverage?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> If you sign up by July 1st, you could start your coverage by August 1st <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q9)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JANET:</strong> I see. Should I call you back at this number when I have made my decision?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> Yes, and here is your reference number: TR278Q <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q10)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JANET:</strong> Got it. Thanks!</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>AGENT:</strong> Thank you, and have a nice day!</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Hey if you’re just joining us on WKPX “The Sound”, welcome. We’re here in the studio with Matt and Cam in the morning, and this morning we’re talking about keeping the kids occupied on summer vacation. Folks, there’s a new kid in town in the world of summer fun. Get ready for the Pool for the People, a pool and outdoor venue created by – that’s right – the people.</p>
                </section>

                <section className="mt-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Scheduled to open in November, the ideas for everything from the design of the pool right down to the items sold in the snack bar have been decided upon by a sample of 1,050 members of the public.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">The public selected two top proposals from over a dozen <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q11)</strong> created by renowned architect Ned Mosby, and the final design is truly something else. The pool is shaped like a fishbowl, sinking down into the ground, and there’s – you guessed it – a real, live fish tank in the centre! It’s certainly the centre of attention in the Bridgewater area <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q12)</strong>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Now, you are probably wondering how much an extravagance like this must cost right? Well, have no fear. At just £15 for adults and £10 for kids, it’s an affordable way to entertain the kids in those dog days of summer. The only problem now is the possibility that it will in fact become too popular! The pool is only so large, so swarms of people coming to enjoy it may cause quite a crowd in its first summer of opening <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q13)</strong>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">There will be an opening party for a select audience, and in line with the pool’s mission, the people have decided on all the arrangements. They collectively decided on actress Rebel Wilson to host the festivities scheduled for later this month, and even dictated the playlist by ranking their top 10 songs from a list of hundreds.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">There is some discrepancy, however, on the sculpture design for the foyer at the entrance <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q14)</strong>. The people elected a jellyfish sculpture to greet entering visitors, but given last week’s vicious attack by a box jellyfish on a local youth, coordinators fear it will bring too much fear to patrons.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">The theme of the clubhouse is set to be “international waters” with a different section representing each continent, designed by the legendary local artist Roberta Anuzzi. Representing Asia in the reception area will be a mosaic made up of prominent animals indigenous to the continent – a camel, a panda, and the Siberian white tiger, to name just a few <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q15)</strong>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">In the West lounge, feel the cool, icy vibes of the Transantarctic Mountains of Antarctica <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q16)</strong>. Makes you cold just thinking about it, doesn’t it? Just seeing a wall with a mural of the glacial mountains is almost enough to cool you off on a December afternoon. Almost.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Why not make the trip to the pool a social studies lesson at the same time? The theme in the lady’s lounge room for Africa may not be what you expected. A safari? Drum music? The Nile River? No, did you know that Africa was home to the first jewelry <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q17)</strong>? I sure didn’t.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">By contrast, as you may expect, North America’s theme for the card room is as modern — even futuristic – as it gets. Anuzzi created for North America a sort of absurdist print interestingly juxtaposing the moon landing of 1969 with an abstract depiction of humans living on Mars. Seems to me like an interesting commentary on the future of space exploration <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q18)</strong>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">And in the men’s lounge room, the ancient forts of Sparta, Rome, Greece, and other European civilisations fittingly exhibit the strength and combatant characteristics of these societies <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q19)</strong>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Finally, the cafe and breakfast room area is an enchanting round room that draws all attention to its centre – where there is a strikingly realistic sculpture of a volcano. The delicious food may actually be only the second most exciting part of this room in comparison to the 9-foot statue complete with brightly colored molten lava to characterise South America <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q20)</strong>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Honestly, it is like a museum visiting each room of the clubhouse. Why not make the trip to the pool an educational one for the kids?</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">We’re going to take a quick commercial break here at WKPX, but we’ll be back in 10 with more on what’s touted to be the Summer’s Hottest Place to Beat the Heat…</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">TUTOR: Before we start, Jimmy and Kathy, thanks for coming in today to talk about your current research paper! Well, I will also give you some suggestions for your future presentation later.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="mt-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIMMY:</strong> That’s great!</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Okay, I have read the introductory chapter <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q21)</span>, and so far I like where you’re going with your research, you two.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KATHY:</strong> Thanks! What did you think of the procedure section?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> I haven’t gotten there yet. I will get to that and the results and discussion section in a bit.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIMMY:</strong> Oh. If you haven’t read the rest, are you just saying you like the introduction?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> No – the layout is really well done <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q22)</span>. You have each section clearly marked and have the header and footer perfectly formatted, and your title page is right on the money. A lot of students have trouble with that one.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIMMY:</strong> To be honest, we did refer a lot to the example we received in class.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> That’s good to do for spacing and layout, as long as you’re not also copying the information. The background information is a little sparse, though. You may want to add to it.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KATHY:</strong> You think so? I was more worried about whether I had enough data.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> You definitely need more background information. I would think about finding some more online articles or doing more research in the campus library <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q23)</span>.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIMMY:</strong> That’s a good idea – we can go tomorrow. I find it too tough finding the subject matter in the online journal database.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> I also like being able to flip through the physical journal as opposed to trying to scroll down on a computer.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KATHY:</strong> Me too. Oh, I almost forgot. I’ve included all of my citations in the abstract, but could you help me with the bibliography <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q24)</span>? I should be using a bibliography, right? Not an appendix?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Sure, I can help with that. Yes – for this type of scientific research paper, list all sources that you cite in the body of your paper in a bibliography. Go to the website I gave you last time to see the exact way to list each source.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KATHY:</strong> Okay, thanks. I’ll do that. We still have a lot of things to fix up.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Yeah, but there’s a lot of good stuff here to work with. So enough about the paper, how is the presentation going?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KATHY:</strong> Well, it’s alright. I am going to go try out the new presentation software <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q25)</span> while Jimmy’s working on the bibliography.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIMMY:</strong> Yeah, we are hoping to make an animation of an actual pump but still have a lot to learn about how to do that.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KATHY:</strong> Who would have thought before we started this project that we would be able to recreate the motion of a pump? This stuff is just so interesting.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> So glad to hear it!</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIMMY:</strong> Yeah, I am glad I took engineering this semester. I would definitely like to keep up with it.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> You know, there’s an organisation called the Machine Engineer Society. You should look into joining it. You would need to score well in your engineering class <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q26)</span> to qualify, but I think you can do it.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KATHY:</strong> Hm, interesting. I will definitely check it out. I would really like to get in contact with some professionals in the engineering field to find out more. I don’t really know anyone in the field now, though.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIMMY:</strong> I think if you keep meeting people in your classes and professors you’ll be able to get in contact with some really helpful people <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q27)</span>.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Well said, Jimmy. If engineering pumps is something you both are specifically interested in, make sure you stay up to date on new developments. In fact, you could visit the local water treatment facility periodically to see what new developments are going on <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q28)</span>.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KATHY:</strong> Hm, that may be a good way to get some practical experience.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Well, I don’t think they would let you handle any equipment by just visiting the facility. If you really want to get your hands dirty, so to speak, I would recommend instead seeking a summer internship <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q29)</span>.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KATHY:</strong> Wow, you have so many helpful suggestions for getting a leg up. Now if only you could tell me how to get my work published!</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIMMY:</strong> Haha, wouldn’t that be nice.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Well, honestly, all you really need to do is once you have a dissertation, present it. Present it often and to many audiences, and once you get feedback, adjust it. You’ll get published one day <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q30)</span>.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>KATHY:</strong> Wow, this meeting has been truly inspiring. Thanks for your help!</p>

                        Tonight I’m going to present an overview of the research on amber. Okay, I’ll start by giving a brief introduction about amber, then talk about the formation of amber, and then describe amber’s applications in different fields. First of all, what is amber? Amber is not a stone, but is ancient, fossilised tree resin, which is the semi-solid amorphous organic substance secreted in pockets and canals through epithelial cells of the plant. And why is resin produced? Although there are contrasting views as to why resin is produced, it is a plant’s protection mechanism. The resin may be produced to protect the tree from disease and injury inflicted by insects <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q31)</strong> and fungi.

                        Amber occurs in a range of different colors. Besides the usual yellow, orange, and brown, other uncommon colors are also associated with it. Interestingly, blue amber, the rarest Dominican amber, is highly sought after. It is only found in Santiago, Dominican Republic. There are several theories about what causes the blue color in amber. The most common one links it to the occurrence of volcanic dust <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q32)</strong> that was present when the resin was first pressed out from hymenaea protera millions of years ago.

                        At this point, you might be curious about how amber is formed. Molecular polymerisation, resulting from high pressures and temperatures produced by overlying sediment, transforms the resin first into copal. Sustained heat <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q33)</strong> and pressure drives off terpenes and results in the formation of amber. Copal that I’ve just mentioned is also a tree resin but it hasn’t fully fossilised to amber. More generally, the term copal describes resinous substances in an intermediate <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q34)</strong> stage of polymerisation and hardening between “gummier” resins and amber.

                        So where can we find amber? It can be found on sea shores <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q35)</strong>. The main producer worldwide is Russia. In fact about 90% of the world’s available amber is located in the Kaliningrad region of Russia, which is located on the Baltic. Here, the resin is washed up on the coast after being dislodged from the ocean floor by years of water and ocean currents. However, exposure to sunlight <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q36)</strong>, rain, and temperate extremes tends to disintegrate resin. This also indicates that amber is not really an ideal fossil preservative for most uses.

                        We’ve already learned that amber is made of tree resin. It often includes insects that were trapped within the tree many millions of years ago. A piece with a visible and well-arranged insect is generally valued much higher than simple, solid amber. One Dominican amber source reported finding a butterfly with a five-inch wing spread; this is both a large and unusual find; most butterfly specimens have no more than a two-inch wingspan. Inclusions in Dominican amber are numerous – 1 inclusion to every 100 pieces; Baltic amber contains approximately 1 inclusion to every 1,000 <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q37)</strong> pieces.

                        Now that you have a basic knowledge of amber, I’d like to talk a bit about amber’s applications in different fields. First, amber is appreciated for its color and beauty. Good quality amber is used to manufacture ornamental objects and jewelry, for instance using a variety of exclusive first class quality natural Baltic amber with silver <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q38)</strong> to make natural amber jewelry. But due to the biodegradation of Amber fossils, people with amber jewelry have to take special care of it, to ensure that the amber is not damaged.

                        It was previously believed that amber worn on the neck served to protect one from diseases of the throat and preserved the sound mind. Kalistrate, a famous doctor in the Roman Empire wrote that amber powder mixed with honey <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q39)</strong> cures throat, eye and ear diseases, and if it is taken with water, eases stomachache. While the mystery around that use of amber has not been cleared, one thing is sure: it will help effectively to defeat small malaises.

                        Amber has even been used as a building <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q40)</strong> material. Amber created the altar in St. Brygida Church in Gdansk, Poland. In St. Petersburg, Russia, the walls of the famous Amber Room were lined with intricate carvings and inlaid designs. This palace room is being reconstructed from photographs, and can be visited at the Catherine Palace, located in the town of Tsarskoye Selo. And finally, the fourth use of amber is that…
