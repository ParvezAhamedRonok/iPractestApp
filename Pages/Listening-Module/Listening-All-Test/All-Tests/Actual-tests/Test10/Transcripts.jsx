                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> Hey Jim, it’s Peter.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> Oh hey Peter. What’s up?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> I thought I’d call so we could hammer out the details for next year’s lease <strong className="text-blue-600">(Example)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> That’s a good idea. Did we ever decide on how to split the total rent?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> Well, I was thinking since my room is bigger I probably should pay a little more, so I could pay £110 and you could pay £80 <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q1)</strong>. Does that sound okay?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> Considering that my old apartment cost me £100 for a smaller room, I’m definitely alright with that! Hey, I was looking at a map of the area, and can’t seem to find a bus stop near it. Do you know where we would catch the bus?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> Well, the bus is actually pretty far from us, but we have that garage <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q2)</strong> that we can park our cars in.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> Wow, that’s great! Convenient parking is hard to find, so we’re lucky we have that. Okay, so we have a whole lot of things we’ll need to buy when we move in – how do you want to split that up?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> I was wondering – do you still work at the supermarket <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q3)</strong>?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> Yep, every Tuesday and Saturday.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> Would you be able to buy things from there if I send you a shopping list?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> Sure, I can do that.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> Great. Then I can take care of whatever else we need that you wouldn’t get at a supermarket. If you want, I’ll pick you up from work that day and we can go to the apartment together.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> That would be great, thanks.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> No problem – that way we can split the cost of petrol <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q4)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> Works for me. It’s so expensive these days, isn’t it?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> It’s downright obscene.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> So let’s figure out what appliances we need. Do we have a microwave?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> Yes, the landlord’s providing that for us. Hey, do you still have that space heater <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q5)</strong> though? We need one for the kitchen since it’s not connected to the central heating.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> Oh, right, I’ll bring that. Anything else?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> Well, I have some dining room and living room furniture I can bring, so that should take care of most of the big stuff. You know what we do need though? Could you bring a toaster <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q6)</strong>?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> I actually don’t have one. It doesn’t come with the microwave?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> No, the landlord is only supplying the microwave. It would really help if you could bring one.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> Okay, I’ll pick one up at the store. You know, I also have this cool antique rotary phone that would be a cool addition to the apartment. Sort of as decoration and utility.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> Oh cool! The only thing is, we’d have to put it in the kitchen, unless you want it in your room.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> Why not put it in the living room?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> The living room is too loud to have a phone conversation. The noise sort of carries, so if one person is trying to watch TV or have friends over the person on the phone won’t be able to hear.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> Hm, okay, well I guess kitchen <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q7)</strong> it is then. Any other big things we need? That seems like everything.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> That’s all I can think of. And of course, move-in is –</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> June 1st <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q8)</strong>. I can’t wait. We’ll be able to watch the big game in our new apartment – it’s going to be awesome!</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> Yeah, we can move in in the morning and then Friday night <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q9)</strong> we can sit back and cheer on Liverpool.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> I have an exam <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q10)</strong> in the morning, but will be done around 11 a.m. and can move in after. Wait…Liverpool? You’re joking, right? I thought you were a Manchester United fan?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> MAN U? No way! Liverpool all the way!</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> Oh no. I don’t know if I can live with a Liverpool fan…</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">You will hear an HR representative from Earn and Learn explaining the company's program to some potential applicants.</p>
                </section>

                <section className="mt-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Representative:</strong> Welcome to all of you…Can everybody see and hear me?… Good…I’m Sarah Conor, an HR representative of Earn and Learn. I have been asked today to talk to you about our company. So, for those of you who don’t know very much about the company, let me start by giving you some basic information about it.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Representative:</strong> Earn and Learn started nearly twenty years ago. It is not a charity but a for-profit company that enables promising entrepreneurs to make money <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q11)</strong> while traveling. During the past ten years, it has grown rapidly and has gained great influence in most countries of the world.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Representative:</strong> We have a partnership with the school <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q12)</strong> and take a large number of recent graduates from the business school. So if you are a recent graduate I’d say you can consider applying to our company.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Representative:</strong> Before your application, you might be curious about what sort of places you could go to. There are four main locations, but you also have the freedom to submit a different location and if they can make the necessary arrangements, you can go. The first country Earn and Learn established locations in was the U.S., where you may choose from multiple locations, as long as you can commit to their more rigid schedule of August to December <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q13)</strong>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Representative:</strong> Also, you could do the Australia <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q14)</strong> internship. That one is really cool – you work at a wildlife shelter and learn about the business practices of nonprofit organisations. You do have to be willing to commit 8 months for that one <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q14)</strong>, though. Perhaps that’s a long time to be so far away, but I would say it is really an amazing opportunity.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Representative:</strong> I don’t know whether some of you are in decent physical shape. If so, the South Africa <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q15)</strong> internship is another exciting one – you learn a lot about sustainable farming – but you would be doing some of the manual labor involved in maintaining a farm. Indeed, it’s hard work, but I think you would definitely be able to do it. It may be wise to wait until after their summer is over so it’s not so terribly hot.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Representative:</strong> In addition, there is a most recently established location in India <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q16)</strong>. This one gives you more of a study abroad feel, given that they arrange a host family for you to stay with <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q16)</strong>. In the other locations, you live in an apartment with other interns, so this is definitely a unique experience.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Representative:</strong> Regardless of where you go, at the end of the program you get a Global Traveling Certificate, as long as you can explain your experience. You can provide a written log of what you did <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q17)</strong>. I recommend writing journal or blog entries about what you do every day, or a weekly summary of each day. Of course you don’t have to write up a formal report or anything like that. And you need to apply for it once you have returned <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q18)</strong>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Representative:</strong> Some students may want to know whether this is a paid internship. Actually you have to pay for the flight there yourself. But you have the opportunity to create your own small business, which could earn you money if it’s successful. So basically you pay for it all up front, but when you’re there you can find ways to make money. That is to say, you pay for two thirds of the cost up front as a deposit, and then give the final installment one month prior to your return <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q19)</strong>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Representative:</strong> Finally, I have to remind you that you need a health check <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q20)</strong> before you go, to make sure you’re not going to spread any communicable diseases. In addition, before you go, you don’t have to attend any meetings or workshops. You’ll meet everyone you’ll be working with once you get there.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Representative:</strong> Okay, well, that’s all I’ve time for today. Thanks for listening and I’m happy to take any questions if you have them…</p>

                </section>

                <section class="mt-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Hi, Professor Timmons? Do you have a few minutes? I was hoping to talk about what I missed on Thursday.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PROFESSOR:</strong> Hello, come in. Sure, sit down. Could you tell me your name please?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Margaret, sir. Margaret Parkinson. I apologise for missing your class but I had to go to the hospital.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PROFESSOR:</strong> I’m sorry to hear that! Everything is OK now though, I hope?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Yes, thanks.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PROFESSOR:</strong> Glad to hear it. So on Thursday I outlined the research project that will account for 30% of your grade. All students will be divided into groups and will give a well-researched presentation to the class covering a specific topic relevant to student life.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Oh, that sounds interesting – can we choose just any topic that pertains to life as a student, like how to start your own student organisation?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PROFESSOR:</strong> Well, though I’m sure that would be an informative presentation, I have already chosen a list of topics which I will assign. As an example, I assigned one group the topic of student loans <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q21)</span>. They are to research not just the prevalence of students who have loans to pay for their tuition, but information as to how best to manage these loans and possible scholarships that could alleviate some of the financial burden.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> That one sounds particularly interesting to me – could I request that topic? I could easily find out a lot about it by stopping by the Finance Office <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q22)</span> on my way to class.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PROFESSOR:</strong> Unfortunately, that one is already taken by another group. I have, however, assigned you to a group and given you all one of two choices.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Oh, I see. What are the choices?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PROFESSOR:</strong> The first is discussing smoking <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q23)</span>. Trends in the number of student smokers compared with the general population, popular reasons students take up smoking, and more healthy alternatives to smoking.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Hm, that one could be interesting. I’m not a smoker myself, but will see what my group thinks. If we did choose this topic, we would rather not put our fellow students on the spot to interview them – where else could we gather information?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PROFESSOR:</strong> How about where the cigarettes are sold?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Oh, that’s a great idea. I could interview the manager of a supermarket <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q24)</span> and find out the average age of people buying cigarettes, or how much they buy, that sort of thing?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PROFESSOR:</strong> Precisely.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Okay, I’ll keep that in mind. And what was the other topic?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PROFESSOR:</strong> The other topic is the practice of natural medicine <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q25)</span>. It sounds far more specific than the others, but it is more an exercise of outlining a career path. If your group chooses this, you would cover the specifics of becoming a Doctor of Natural Medicine, how to become licensed to practice natural medicine, what the career outlook is, etc. You could find much of the information you need on this in the Careers Office <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q26)</span>.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Wow, that would be really helpful not just in learning about natural medicine, but in how to approach researching any career path.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PROFESSOR:</strong> That’s the idea. I want groups to really think outside the box to find information on their topics. They should interview multiple sources.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Okay, now I think I have the general idea.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> When is the presentation due?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PROFESSOR:</strong> I expect each group to send me an email attachment <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q27)</span> of the plan ahead of time – by October 10th – so that I can ensure that you are on the right track.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Oh, that’s actually really reassuring. I would hate to spend so much time on a presentation only to find we had taken it in the wrong direction! So when is the presentation?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PROFESSOR:</strong> I let groups choose from the list of time slots I have between November 1st and November 5th <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q28)</span>.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Okay, how about the 3rd? I’ll have to check with my group, of course, but maybe we could write a tentative time?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PROFESSOR:</strong> Sure, let me take a look. I’m actually booked completely through the 3rd and 4th now. How about sometime in the afternoon of the 5th?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Great! How about 2 o’clock?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PROFESSOR:</strong> No problem. I’ll pencil your group in.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Okay, thanks. And to clarify, what exactly is due in the first phase?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PROFESSOR:</strong> Before the October deadline, I want your group to have compiled resources and then to provide some initial data analysis <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q29)</span> to support your claims.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Okay, so data analysis is due the 10th of October, and then the um, the</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PROFESSOR:</strong> – Presentation <span class="font-bold text-red-500">(Q30)</span>? Yes. The final phase is simply giving the presentation on the 5th of November.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Alright, I think I have all the information I need. Thanks!</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PROFESSOR:</strong> You’re welcome. See you in class tomorrow.</p>

                        Today I’d like to tell you about how U.K. architects are playing their part to address the issue of global warming. You have seen many of these iconic buildings while going about your everyday life, but you may not know how they are affecting your tomorrow.

                        In 2003, construction was completed on the famous Swiss Re Building, or more informally called the Gherkin, a true masterpiece commissioned by the law <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q31)</strong> offices of Foster and Partners.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
                        This is not the first ambitious endeavor of the firm – they are renowned for their various philanthropic, environmental efforts. The Gherkin, with its cutting-edge green initiative and sharp design, is gaining recognition as an icon in modern architecture. You can pick it out of the London skyline by its unorthodox cigar <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q32)</strong> shape.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
                        While its appearance is the obvious attribute at which to marvel, there is far more to this building than meets the eye. And let’s face it – there’s a lot about this building that meets the eye. The building helps reduce the city’s carbon footprints <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q33)</strong> in a number of ways.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
                        Just a quick note – in case you’re not familiar with the term ‘carbon footprints,’ get used to it! It’s a buzzword you’ll hear relentlessly to talk about reducing emissions. Think of it as the amount of harmful greenhouse gases that are given off into the environment by a single person, organisation, or product.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
                        So going back to the Gherkin Building – perhaps the most obvious as well as the most significant eco-friendly feature is the glass windows, which allow light <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q34)</strong> to pass through the building, both reducing heating costs and brightening up the workspace.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
                        The ingenuity behind the various eco-friendly aspects of the Gherkin has seen its fair share of publicity both from serious and silly sources. In a recent April Fool’s Day edition, one e-publication printed a story detailing plans to replace 50% of the current exterior with grass <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q35)</strong>, which would not only make large steps in the name of sustainability, but also give the building the green hue that would truly earn it the nickname of the Gherkin. The only drawback is, as you may have guessed, that this story was an April Fool’s Day joke and completely made up.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
                        In all seriousness though, the building is setting a new standard of design that other architects and city planners just cannot ignore. The building’s bold and cost-efficient design has won a number of architecture awards, including the Stirling Prize, the London Region Award, and the Emporis Skyscraper Award among others. The design comfortably accommodates a large number of offices while keeping maintenance and operation costs down, striking a superb balance between nature <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q36)</strong> and the workplace.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
                        Nature is well and good, as long as the weather is nice outside. Given London’s notoriously bad weather, the architects knew they must devise a quality temperature regulation system, and that they did. A special system designed to reduce the building’s reliance on air-conditioning <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q37)</strong> was devised that cuts consumption in half compared to standard office buildings. There are atria that link each floor vertically to one another, forming spiraling spaces up the entire building. They serve not just as social common spaces but also act as the building’s lungs <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q38)</strong>, distributing clean air from the opening panels in the facade through the entire building.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
                        The building isn’t all business though – it has its fair share of fun as well. At the very top, a clubroom <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q39)</strong> offers a picturesque entertainment spot for company functions, private parties, etc., with a breathtaking panoramic view of the city.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
                        The creation of such an innovative structure has many wondering what the future of urban planning and architecture may be. Well, if the other projects currently commissioned by Foster and Partners are any indication, the entire city <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q40)</strong> constructed with similarly eco-friendly buildings is not far in the distance. The Masdar City development aims to create a desert city that produces zero waste and removes as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as it puts in – a huge feat in protecting our earth.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
                        The Gherkin is a truly impressive feat, yet it is not the only one worth noting. Now to move on to another green initiative, I’ll tell you about the Eden Foundation Building, found in Cornwall…
