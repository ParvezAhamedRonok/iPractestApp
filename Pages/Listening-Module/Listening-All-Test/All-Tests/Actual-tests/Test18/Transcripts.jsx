                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> Yes, just 5 minutes walk.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WILL:</strong> What’s the post code?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> 7424.. I..I mean, sorry, 7 4 3 4. <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q3)</strong></p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WILL:</strong> And, what’s your telephone number?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> Well, I don’t have a home number but I’ve got a mobile.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WILL:</strong> That’ll do fine.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> It’s o six six three four nine eight two seven four six. Did you get that?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WILL:</strong> Some of it. Can you say it again?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> The code’s 06634 and the number’s then 982 746. <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q5)</strong></p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WILL:</strong> Right. That’s almost it. Now I need some kind of identification to prove where you live. Do you have a driving license or a passport or anything like that?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> I’m afraid that everything I have, has got my old address on it. Do you need it now?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WILL:</strong> No, not now, but you won’t be able to take anything out until we see that.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> Wait a minute. I’ve got a letter addressed to me here that arrived this morning. Will that do?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WILL:</strong> Oh yes. That’s a good idea. That will be fine. Let’s look. Ok. Well, that’s that finished.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WILL:</strong> Could I ask you a few questions? The Council that runs the library is running a survey to find out what kind of books people prefer so that they can direct their buying.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> Yeah, no problem.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WILL:</strong> OK. So, what type of books do you like?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> Well, I’m very keen on mysteries <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q6)</strong>. You know, when a detective is trying to find out who did the murder. Historical novels interest me too <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q7)</strong>. Romance never! My sister loves them but they bore me to tears. I quite like books on animals too <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q8)</strong>. I get them out sometimes. Not science fiction either. Too weird.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WILL:</strong> Well, I think that’s it then.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> Good. Oh, do you charge anything?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WILL:</strong> The library is free <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q9)</strong> unless you want to rent out some of our videos or DVDs.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> How much is that?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WILL:</strong> Well, we rent videos out for four dollars each and DVDs are six dollars. You must leave us a deposit for $60 or $60 as well. That’s returnable of course. <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q10)</strong></p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> I don’t think I’ll get any of those just yet. Can I pay later?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WILL:</strong> Sure, just give the money in when you’re ready to rent them out.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> Well thanks very much. You’ve been very helpful. I might take a book out now for the weekend, if that’s OK?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>WILL:</strong> Go ahead.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>PETER:</strong> Well, goodbye.</p>

                </section>

                <section class="mt-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Hello everyone. I’ve just been joined in the studio by Dr. Matthew Johnson. Dr. Johnson works at Westley General hospital and he is here today to tell us all about giving blood. Good morning Matthew.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Matthew:</strong> Good morning.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Interviewer:</strong> So, Matthew. Why is it important for us to give blood?</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Matthew:</strong> Donating blood is not important. It’s actually vital that people do this. Without donated blood, thousands of people would die every year and it’s something that could affect everyone.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">We all expect blood to be there for us, but barely a fraction of those who can give, do. Yet sooner or later, virtually all of us will face a time of great vulnerability in which we will need blood. And that time is all too often unexpected. The need for blood is great. On any given day, an average of 38 thousand units of red blood cells are needed. Blood transfusions are often needed for victims of things such as accidents and burns <strong class="text-blue-600 font-bold">(Q11)</strong>, heart surgery, organ transplants <strong class="text-blue-600 font-bold">(Q12)</strong>, and patients receiving treatment for leukaemia, cancer <strong class="text-blue-600 font-bold">(Q13)</strong> or other diseases. In 2002, nearly 29 million units of blood components were transfused. And with an aging population and advances in medical treatments and procedures requiring blood transfusions, the demand for blood continues to increase.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Interviewer:</strong> We really need that much?</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Matthew:</strong> Yes. And we need it now. Blood supplies nationwide have reached critically low levels, with less than one day’s supply of several blood types. Thousands of accident victims, cancer patients, premature babies <strong class="text-blue-600 font-bold">(Q14)</strong> and countless others who need blood to stay alive are hoping you’ll care enough to help them. All blood types are needed.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Interviewer:</strong> What are the different types?</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Matthew:</strong> It’s a bit more complicated than that. First we collect the whole blood from donors and then it’s sorted into the different types which are basically O, A, B or AB though there are also divisions here. Then the blood is split into its constituent parts. We divide it into 4 basic parts. First there are the red blood cells, then the white blood cells, then things called platelets and finally plasma. This is shipped off to hospitals where they use the blood parts that the patients need.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Interviewer:</strong> What are the different parts used for?</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Matthew:</strong> Well, as I said before the whole blood is your blood in its natural state and something we rarely use. It’s much more useful to us to have it separated into its component parts. Red blood cells are what everyone associates with blood, i.e.: it’s red. It’s widely used to replace lost blood during surgery or when people hemorrhage. Its main function is to carry oxygen to cells <strong class="text-blue-600 font-bold">(Q15)</strong>. White blood cells are the most important part of the body’s immune system <strong class="text-blue-600 font-bold">(Q16)</strong> and they’re used for patients whose normal defense systems aren’t working properly. Platelets are crucial for making your blood clot and we need to give them to patients who suffer from illnesses that deplete their natural levels of platelets or they will bleed to death. Finally, plasma is what carries the other parts of blood around <strong class="text-blue-600 font-bold">(Q17)</strong> and needs to be administered with any of the other components. Take away the red blood cells and this is actually yellow.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Interviewer:</strong> So, that’s what blood is all about. Now, you’re here in Westley today to collect blood. Can you tell us where and when we can donate?</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Matthew:</strong> Of course! We’re set up here today, that’s Wednesday, and for the next two days at Westley General Hospital at the Outpatients Department <strong class="text-blue-600 font-bold">(Q18)</strong>. Come along between 9am and 4.30pm <strong class="text-blue-600 font-bold">(Q19)</strong> and we’ll be able to deal with you within one hour. And let me tell you a few things that will calm your fears about giving blood. Aside from a brief needle prick, it doesn’t hurt to give blood. Your body will replace the blood you donate within days of your donation. And finally you can’t catch AIDS, hepatitis or any other disease by giving blood. And of course, you get a cup of tea and a biscuit afterward.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Interviewer:</strong> And can anyone give blood?</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Matthew:</strong> Almost everyone. Donors must be in generally good health, be at least 17 years of age <strong class="text-blue-600 font-bold">(Q20)</strong>, weigh no less than 110 pounds, have not received a tattoo within the past year and not have donated whole blood within the past 56 days. We screen donors with a series of questions before we take the blood so, if you’re unsure, come down and we’ll let you know. Please come down and see us. Remember, if you can donate one pint of blood, this can save up to three lives.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Well, thanks Matthew. I for one will definitely be going down to Westley General to donate.</p>

                    </p>
                </section>

                <section class="mt-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> Hello there. Do you work in the computer room? Yes, I do. Can I help you?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> Well, I’m a first year and I know that I’ll need to use the computer room for my work as I don’t have a computer of my own. So, I thought I’d get down here and see what I have to do in order to get time on one of the university’s computers.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DAVE:</strong> OK. There are 4 computer labs open to undergraduates. The others can only be used by the staff <span class="font-bold text-blue-500">(Q21)</span> and postgraduates. The names of the 4 labs that you can use are Wimborne, Franklin, Salisbury, and Court. Wimborne and Court are in this building, the Johnson building, Franklin is in the Computer Sciences building, and Salisbury is in the library. <span class="font-bold text-blue-500">(Q22)</span></p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> So I can use them whenever I like?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DAVE:</strong> Well, you can use them but not whenever you like. As you can imagine, they’re in quite a lot of demand, so you have to reserve your time on a computer. In each of the labs, there is a reservation book, and you can reserve your time on a computer in that for 2 hours daily <span class="font-bold text-blue-500">(Q23)</span>. If a computer is free though, you can go on it straight away. It’s quite straightforward, but be sure to always write your name in the reservation book in pen <span class="font-bold text-blue-500">(Q24)</span> or someone can rub it out and put their name in instead.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> Oh my God! Does that really happen?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DAVE:</strong> I’m afraid so. And far more often than you would think. When people are stressed about their assignments, they’ll do anything to get some time on the computers. Better not try it yourself though, or you’ll be banned from the computers for the rest of the academic year and your password and username will be taken away.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> That reminds me. I’ve got to get a username and password. How do I go about that then?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DAVE:</strong> Well, what I’ll do is pass you over to my colleague, Jane, as she’s in charge of all that. Jane!</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JANE:</strong> Yes, Dave.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>DAVE:</strong> I’ve got a new student here wanting to find out about usernames and passwords. Can you help him out with that?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JANE:</strong> Yeah sure. Hi there.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> Hi.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JANE:</strong> Well, it’s a straightforward process. First of all, tell me your name and I’ll type it into the system.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> James Smith.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JANE:</strong> Right, let me do that. You see, all students are automatically given a username and then they just choose a password themselves. OK. So, your username is James smith – that’s all small case. That means there must be more than one of you at the university at the moment. Well, what do you want your password to be? <span class="font-bold text-blue-500">(Q25)</span></p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> I think I’ll choose biology <span class="font-bold text-blue-500">(Q25)</span>, as that’s the subject that I’m studying, though my girlfriend Mary will be upset that it’s not her name I’m using.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JANE:</strong> Well, that’s all done. You can now use any of the four undergraduate computer labs.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> By the way, can I print out stuff at the labs?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JANE:</strong> Yes, you can, but sometimes it’s not quick. When you print, it goes into a queue and it will be left in a tray in Franklin <span class="font-bold text-blue-500">(Q26)</span>, as that’s where all the main printers are. The good bit is that, although last year it cost 3 pence per page, now it doesn’t cost you anything. <span class="font-bold text-blue-500">(Q27)</span></p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> I don’t really know much about computing. Is there any training available?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JANE:</strong> Yes. We have introductory courses for all new students. There is beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Which would you like to go for?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> Well, I have done some, but I don’t know if I’m up to anything more than beginner <span class="font-bold text-blue-500">(Q28)</span>. I’d better stick with that. Intermediate could be too tough.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JANE:</strong> Well, your course is in Franklin then <span class="font-bold text-blue-500">(Q29)</span>. We’re in Court now. You know where that is?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JIM:</strong> That’s in this building too, isn’t it?</p>

                        Tutor: Good afternoon everyone. In today’s seminar we are going to continue listening to different students giving us a presentation on the subject of their term paper. Now today is Hillary’s turn. So, what are you going to talk about today Hillary?

                        Hillary: Well, some of you will know that I was brought up when I was young in Japan and I’m going to do my term paper on Japan’s bullet trains, which have revolutionized their rail industry. Japan’s main island Honshu is covered by a network of high-speed train lines that connect Tokyo with most of the island’s major cities and Fukuoka on the island of Kyushu. Japan’s high-speed trains are called shinkansen but are known to us bullet trains. The Japanese bullet train system is credited with being the world’s first purpose built high-speed railway, and the model and inspiration for all other similar type systems running today such as the French TGV. The reputation it has earned for safety, speed and punctuality is unsurpassed. I’d like to give you some figures about that. As regards safety, there has never been a death on the bullet train system since it’s inception in 1964 <strong class="text-blue-600"><b>(Q31)</b></strong>, other than that caused by deliberate passenger misadventure.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
                        As far as speed is concerned the bullet train holds the current world records for the fastest average speed <strong class="text-blue-600"><b>(Q32)</b></strong> between two station stops, which was 260 1.8 kph between Hiroshima and Kokura. The train travelled 192 kilometers in 44 minutes. This record is from the 500 series “Nozomi” trains running at a maximum speed of 300 kilometers an hour between Shin-Osaka and Hakata. I’ll talk more about them later. The punctuality puts European train services to shame. Most trains arrive at their destination, after several hours, to within the second!
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
                        In one year, the total time that all bullets trains were late by was 12 seconds <strong class="text-blue-600"><b>(Q33)</b></strong>! This statistic is hard to believe but it would be difficult to prove otherwise and that’s what the rail authorities in Japan have told us.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
                        Now I’d like to tell you a bit about their history. The first bullet train was introduced in 1964 by Central & West Japan Railways for the Tokyo to Osaka route. Most of these old trains have now been discontinued. There have been several bullet train models since then. The most recent ones have been the 300, 500 and 700 series and it’s the 500 series one that can travel at 300 kph. The bullet trains operating in Japan today are of the three following categories: Nozomi, Hikari and Kodama. The Nozomi trains stop only at the most important stations <strong class="text-blue-600"><b>(Q34)</b></strong>, and reach Osaka from Tokyo in only about two and a half hours and it’s the most modern of bullet trains that serve as Nozomi.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
                        Hikari trains stop a little bit more frequently than Nozomi trains, and need roughly three hours to reach Osaka from Tokyo. Kodama trains stop at all stations <strong class="text-blue-600"><b>(Q35)</b></strong> and they are the local trains among bullet trains. Older models of bullet trains serve as Kodama.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
                        I’d like now to talk a little bit about the technology involved in bullet trains. The Shinkansen bullet trains consist of electrically powered cars. That means basically all individual cars are equipped with electric motor driving systems. This is in contrast to locomotive trains in which the locomotive pulls the passenger coaches. The realization of the high-speed Shinkansen with the electric train system had a great significance. The French “Train a Grande Vitesse” or TGV runs on a centralised power system <strong class="text-blue-600"><b>(Q36)</b></strong>, in which the heavyweight, high-output locomotives at both ends pull the passenger coaches. It’s a system suitable to European railways, which run basically on straight tracks in wide plains with solid foundations. However it is unsuitable in Japan where the ground is flimsy and the tracks full of curves and undulations and inter-city distances are short <strong class="text-blue-600"><b>(Q37)</b></strong>, making it necessary for the trains to accelerate and decelerate frequently.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
                        One of the advantages of the electric car system is that the motor functions as a brake to reduce the speed of the train <strong class="text-blue-600"><b>(Q38)</b></strong>. When the power feed to the electric car motors is stopped, the wheels continue revolving, keeping the motors rotating, resulting in electricity generation by magnetic induction <strong class="text-blue-600"><b>(Q39)</b></strong>. As the force acts in the direction opposite to the axles motion, it functions as a brake to the train. All the motors equipped on each coach can be utilized effectively to reduce the speed, making the electric train system advantageous on Japanese railways, which involve frequent deceleration and acceleration. In addition, by virtue of the remarkable progress achieved recently in semiconductor technologies, the electric train system has undergone tremendous improvements in power, operability and safety administration, so the system is becoming increasingly advantageous <strong class="text-blue-600"><b>(Q40)</b></strong>.
