                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Peter:</strong> Okay Mary, I know I’m putting on weight with all my bad eating habits.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Mary:</strong> That’s right. Chocolate bars, pizzas, and all washed down with litres of soft drink. And with all the sugar in soft drink <strong className="text-blue-600">(Example)</strong>, I think we can say you’re definitely overindulging, don’t you think?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Peter:</strong> I know, I know. I intend to definitely stop drinking that from now on.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Mary:</strong> And that’s part of the sensible eating plan that we have agreed we need to formulate—one that we can both follow.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Peter:</strong> That’s right, sensible, and practical <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q1)</strong> — allowing us to indulge in some sweet foods on occasions.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Mary:</strong> On rare occasions, and we’re going to cut out all the pizzas <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q2)</strong> and hamburgers.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Peter:</strong> Well, not totally. I thought you said pizzas could be eaten once a week. You know how I like pizzas.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Mary:</strong> No. I said once every two months. Once a week was ice cream, not pizza.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Peter:</strong> Yeah, that’s because you like ice cream. I prefer pizza.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Mary:</strong> Peter, if you want to lose weight, you need to be disciplined, in both what you eat, and what you do, which brings us to the issue of exercise.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Peter:</strong> That’s right. So, jogging twice a week, and hiking on Saturdays, right?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Mary:</strong> No, hiking is Sundays, allowing Saturdays for the light walking <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q3)</strong> exercise.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Peter:</strong> So what’s happening this Saturday? A walk around the city?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Mary:</strong> That’s later in the month. This Saturday we’ll visit Pine Park <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q4)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Peter:</strong> Hill Park is nicer, with great views, too.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Mary:</strong> Yes, but we have to travel too far to reach Hill Park, so I ruled that out, and I love the smell of pines.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Peter:</strong> And what about the weekday meals? Salads every night, I suppose?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Mary:</strong> No, it’s important to vary the meals so that the food remains interesting and fun. The only common factor is the fruit juice <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q5)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Peter:</strong> I’d rather have meat every night, but you’re the boss.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Mary:</strong> If you want to lose weight, you’ll have to accept this program, okay?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Peter:</strong> Okay.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Peter:</strong> Now Mary, you said we could have a little treat in our diet plan three times a week: specifically, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Mary:</strong> Yes. A very small treat, but something to reward us for all the discipline shown.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Peter:</strong> So, on Tuesdays, what can I choose? <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q6)</strong></p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Mary:</strong> You have a choice between a small serving of chocolate, ice cream, or biscuits.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Peter:</strong> Okay, well, I’ll go for the biscuits <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q6)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Mary:</strong> That’s a good idea.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Peter:</strong> I’ll eat the ice cream on Thursdays <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q7)</strong>, not the chocolate.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Mary:</strong> Well, if you’re having that, then I’ll have the chocolate <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q8)</strong>.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Peter:</strong> And then you can have the chocolate on Sunday <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q9)</strong>, right?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Mary:</strong> No, I’m sticking to the original plan, with ice cream to finish the week, and not another dose of chocolate <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q10)</strong>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">You will hear a childcare worker telling some mothers about the advantages of her centre.</p>
                </section>

                <section className="mt-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Childcare Worker:</strong> Hello everyone, and welcome to the Stanfield Childcare Centre. Now I know you’re all new mothers, and you like to cling to your children. You’ve certainly spent a lot of time raising them to the age of four and are perhaps reluctant to leave them here at our centre. Well, one of the first things you should understand is that here it is safe — very safe. Look around and you’ll see that every room has <span className="font-bold">padded</span> <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q11)</strong> walls. Other centres have standard painted walls, but here, we have invested a lot to ensure your children will not hurt themselves when running around and possibly tripping over.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Childcare Worker:</strong> This padding extends around all <span className="font-bold">corners</span> <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q12)</strong> — that is, the areas most likely to bruise and cut your active little child. So, you can rest assured that any accidents of a physical nature are not likely to happen here.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Childcare Worker:</strong> Now, you don’t want to dump your child at this centre and let them waste their time. You want them to learn, and that’s one of the greatest assets of our establishment. Our staff are not only trained childcare workers, but all of them have a <span className="font-bold">special skill</span> <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q13)</strong>, which they can impart to your child, whether it be teaching the ABC, some basic mathematics, artistic skills, or physical education.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Childcare Worker:</strong> We are particularly known for our pre-school literacy program and have a wealth of <span className="font-bold">learning toys</span> <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q14)</strong>, specially designed to develop your child’s potential.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Childcare Worker:</strong> Of course, one concern many mothers have is that, in environments such as these, colds and flus and other viral nasties can be easily spread around. It’s a very legitimate concern, and one which we take seriously, and we pride ourselves on our precautions. For a start, unlike most centres which clean with standard detergents, we <span className="font-bold">disinfect</span> <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q15)</strong> every surface at the end of every day, using a special disinfectant wash.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Childcare Worker:</strong> Some places just wipe surfaces daily with a damp cloth, but not us. And that’s just the start. We also physically check your children when they arrive every day, and if we feel your child is sick, we ask him or her to wear a face mask to ensure <span className="font-bold">germs</span> <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q16)</strong> are not transmitted. If your child is noticeably sick, then we ask you to take them back home to recover.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Childcare Worker:</strong> Now, at Stanfield Childcare Centre we have excellent childcare officers, and let me briefly introduce them. We have Susan, Andrea, Bella, Cathy, Lisa, and Liz. They’re all fully trained and come with some individual assets which make them even better.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Childcare Worker:</strong> Bella, for instance, knows children very well, having worked here for five years, and Cathy has her own family — two little girls — so she can talk to you with first-hand knowledge of what it’s really like to raise children <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q17)</strong>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Childcare Worker:</strong> But getting back to Bella, she often relaxes here after work, spending long hours chatting to parents, as does Cathy in fact. But in terms of hours, nothing can compare to Andrea, who will sometimes spend the night here, staying in our <span className="font-bold">overnight room</span> <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q18)</strong>.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Childcare Worker:</strong> Bella, for example, used to be quite shy herself but now is marvelous with the little kiddies, as outgoing as any of them. We let Cathy, though, deal with the particularly quiet and introverted children <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q19)</strong>, since having her own family, she knows what can really bring them out.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex flex-wrap"><strong>Childcare Worker:</strong> Of course, what better way to do this than with yummy homemade cakes, and Cathy often gets these from Bella, who can make some of the best in town <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q20)</strong>. Yes, everyone here brings something special, which is why we’re one of the best childcare centres in the business.</p>

                        You will hear a student, Eric, talking to his lecturer, Ms Harris, about essay writing.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section className="mt-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Eric:</strong> Hi, Ms Harris. Here we are, talking once again.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Ms Harris:</strong> Well, I’m always willing to help out wherever possible. Is anything troubling you?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Eric:</strong> Well, your advice last week about writing summaries was very useful, and I’m using these summaries a lot in order to prepare my final master’s thesis.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Ms Harris:</strong> But you’re having problems, right?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Eric:</strong> Yes, I have a few issues to discuss. Obviously I want a good essay, and I want to achieve high marks. But I’m not sure on the best way to start.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Ms Harris:</strong> That’s an easy question. Start with a <span className="font-bold text-red-500">topic</span> <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q21)</span>, but not one that I necessarily suggest, but one that you want to explore. You will always write better when doing so on a topic you are interested in, not one imposed upon you by others.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Eric:</strong> Well, I’m interested in management theory.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Ms Harris:</strong> Then pursue that. However, that alone is far too broad. Break it into various <span className="font-bold text-red-500">current</span> <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q22)</span> areas of discussion and relevance, then look more carefully at one of them — say, management and cultural differences, or management and motivation, or other aspects, such as the role of salary, group cohesion, or leadership.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Eric:</strong> I would say I’m interested in group cohesion—that is, how people interact in the workplace.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Ms Harris:</strong> Well, that’s a start, but you can’t then just write planlessly, without defining exactly what you intend to do within the area you’ve chosen. You’ll have to think of a <span className="font-bold text-red-500">thesis</span> <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q23)</span>, and this statement could be of several types.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Eric:</strong> Such as what?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Ms Harris:</strong> Oh, you could argue a point, something that you believe in; or discuss an issue, looking at its various perspectives; or critique the opinions of others, pointing out the pitfalls and flaws. The thesis statement will make that very clear because it will say, in simple terms, what you intend to achieve in your essay.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Eric:</strong> I see. And then I can just begin writing, right?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Ms Harris:</strong> Wrong! If your essay is going to be clear, it needs to be logical and organised, and this means you’ll need an <span className="font-bold text-red-500">outline</span> <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q24)</span>. This could be written as a flowchart, or spider graph — that is, a series of connected lines, but whatever shape the outline takes, there must be a sense of <span className="font-bold text-red-500">progress</span> <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q25)</span>, in, more or less, a straight line, towards a goal.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Eric:</strong> And then my essay will be good?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Ms Harris:</strong> With such progression, definitely—as long as you do achieve everything that you set out to do, as specified in the beginning, okay?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Eric:</strong> Well, Ms Harris, your advice about essay writing all sounds very useful: solid, and step by step, so I’ll certainly follow that. But can you tell me in more general terms, what constitutes the best essay?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Ms Harris:</strong> Oh, there are many <span className="font-bold text-red-500">aspects</span> <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q26)</span> to consider, but one of the most important is certainly, original thinking...</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Eric:</strong> I think I can do that.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Ms Harris:</strong> ...whenever you use an example, or facts or figures that are not commonly known, you must give a <span className="font-bold text-red-500">reference</span> <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q28)</span>. That’s an academic necessity, without which your writing will automatically fail.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Eric:</strong> So, it’s necessary to give these. Right.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Ms Harris:</strong> Absolutely—and with that, your essay will be fine, but always ensure that you format it clearly...</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Eric:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Ms Harris:</strong> I mean the practical considerations, as written in the university <span className="font-bold text-red-500">style guide</span> <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q29)</span>...</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Eric:</strong> I can certainly do that.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Ms Harris:</strong> ...Your individual lecturers will give you a word-count figure, so follow what they say, making your essay neither too long, nor too short—perhaps <span className="font-bold text-red-500">10%</span> <span className="font-bold text-green-500">(Q30)</span> either way should be acceptable.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Eric:</strong> I guess I can do all that. Thanks for your advice.</p>

                        You will hear a lecturer discussing the history of people’s beliefs regarding whether the sun, or the Earth, is at the centre of the solar system.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section className="mt-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">In the night sky, the stars appear to revolve around the Earth, rising in the east, and disappearing in the west. The Earth itself seems solid, fixed, and stable, and such common sense perception suggests that the Earth is the centre of the universe. This is known as ‘geo’ ‘centrism’, with geo meaning Earth, and all pre-modern civilisations drew this conclusion <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q31)</strong>. We now know, of course, that the Earth revolves around the sun, and this is called ‘helio’ ‘centrism’, with helio meaning sun, but historically, it took quite a while for this to be deduced.</p> <br />

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">As early as the third century BC, an ancient Greek astronomer, Aristarchus of Samos, proposed heliocentrism, but received little support from his peers. Similarly, throughout subsequent history, isolated individuals proposed this new idea, but again, no one was listening <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q32)</strong>. Geocentrism just seemed too logical to refute. Geocentrism also fitted the views of the established Christian church, who could quote biblical passages such as ‘the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved’. Those who dared disagree were subject to accusations of heresy, often with dire punishments to follow.</p> <br />

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">The trouble was, as the night sky was observed more closely, that simple revolution of the stars proved not so simple at all. In relation to the others stars, some steadily wandered in given directions, then sometimes reversed for months, and disappeared altogether. They were called planets, meaning ‘wanderers’. In addition, the position of the sun and moon altered slightly over the year, and comets, those mysterious glowing spots, would come and go. In order to predict the motion of the planets, and accurately serve the primary purpose of navigation for sailing ships, increasingly elaborate mathematical models were needed—a sure sign that something was not quite right <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q33)</strong>.</p> <br />

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Heliocentrism, or the belief that the sun is the centre of the solar system, still needed a mathematically-sound description before it could be scientifically accepted, and it was a Polish astronomer, Nicolaus Copernicus, who, in 1543, first published this. This event is sometimes referred to as the Copernican revolution <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q34)</strong>. Copernicus himself certainly feared the consequences of his proof, knowing full well it might invoke the anger of the established church. Probably for this reason, he waited until the last year of his life, when he was sick <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q35)</strong> and dying, to release his findings. In addition, the preface of the book, written by a respected member of the church, stated that the model was not necessarily correct. As a result of this, there was no ‘revolution” whatsoever—in fact, the book received scant attention <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q36)</strong> in the subsequent decades, apart from a few irate clergy men who angrily dismissed the whole scheme as irrelevant.</p> <br />

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Yet the following generations of astronomers did not always fare so well. The Italian scientist, Galileo, got into trouble, as did a fellow Italian, with the surname Bruno, Giordano Bruno <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q37)</strong>, who was burnt at the stake, yet ultimately, nothing could slow the spread of heliocentrism across Europe. It formed the basis of Isaac Newton’s great work on the motion of the planets — a work which implied that even the sun, around which the Earth circled, was itself in motion <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q38)</strong> around a common centre of gravity.</p> <br />

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">No discourse about heliocentrism could finish without mentioning that, somewhat unbelievably, there still exists those today who choose to believe that the Earth is the centre of the universe. Modern geocentrism is usually the result of literal interpretations of the Bible <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q39)</strong>, which is the cornerstone of these people’s beliefs. They, therefore, also believe in creationism — that is, that a God created everything, and while we may smile at this, it is sobering to consider that surveys have revealed that up to 10% of British people, 12% of Europeans, 20% <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q40)</strong> of the USA, and 25% of the Middle East, still hold the belief that the sun revolves around the Earth. One can only wonder what Copernicus would have thought of this.</p>
