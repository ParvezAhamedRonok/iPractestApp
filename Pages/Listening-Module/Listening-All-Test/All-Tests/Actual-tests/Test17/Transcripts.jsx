                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Good morning everyone. I’d like to welcome you all to Westley University Library. This is a 20-minute tour around the library to show you all the facilities and all you will need to know to start off your life here as a student at the University. What I’ll start by doing is telling you about what you need to do to join the library. Then I’ll briefly tell you about our facilities and then I’ll guide you quickly round and show you everything.</p>
                </section>

                <section className="mt-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Representative:</strong> So to join the Library you need to go to the reception between the hours of 9am and 5pm. After that the reception closes, though all the other facilities will stay open until 10pm. At the reception they’ll give you an application form. After you fill that in, you’ll have to give us the fee of five <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q11)</strong>, which you have to give us every year that you’re a member of the Library. We will also need to see your University Card <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q12)</strong> to confirm that you’re a student of the University and finally we’ll need 2 passport photos – 1 for our records and the other for your Library card. You will need to do all this as soon as possible so you’ll be able to use the facilities at once. I’m sure your workload will begin to build up soon!</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Representative:</strong> Now, let me tell you a bit about the facilities. The Library opens daily <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q13)</strong> from 8am to 10pm though, as I told you earlier, the Reception operates only between the hours of 9am and 5pm, although this is extended to 6.30pm on Fridays <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q14)</strong> to give students more time to organise their book requirements for the weekend. The reception is closed on Sundays. Undergraduate students are permitted to take out 4 books at any one time and each book may be borrowed for a period of two weeks post may borrow 6 books <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q15)</strong> at a time. Borrowing time can be extended by a period of one week <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q16)</strong> per book if the student comes into the Library in person with the book in question so it can be reached. We do not renew book borrowing over the phone. If you are late in returning any book, then you will be charged a fine of two for every week that you are late. You won’t be able to take out any other books until this fine is paid. This is not a method of earning money for the Library but merely what we have to do to ensure that all students have access to all the books that they will need.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Representative:</strong> Ok then. Onto the layout of the library. We’re on the ground floor of the library at the moment. Here we have the reception, the computers <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q17)</strong>, which you can use to search for books and their location, and the bathrooms, which are behind the reception. The rest of the ground floor is taken up by the non section <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q18)</strong> of the library. Here we keep all the books, which are either too valuable or are used too much to lend out. You can reserve time with these books at reception and use them during any time that the library is open but, of course, you may not remove them from the Library.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Representative:</strong> On the first floor above us, we have the Arts section <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q19)</strong>, which includes books that students will need for such as languages, literature, art and history. On the second floor is the science section. We’ll see these in a minute. Of course, individual departments will usually have their specialist libraries in their buildings, though the computer catalogs here will list them so you know where to find everything, whether it’s here or in the specialist libraries.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Representative:</strong> Finally, in the basement <strong className="text-blue-600">(Q20)</strong> we have the stack system, which contains the University collection of magazines and journals that we have collected and to which we subscribe.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Representative:</strong> If there is anything that we do not have or that you can’t find, please go to reception and let them know the details. The University operates a swap system with other universities and we can arrange for volumes that we do not possess to be sent here on a limited loan.</p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>Representative:</strong> Well, those are the basic details about the University Library.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Good morning everyone. Well, in today’s tutorial we’re going to discuss the essays that you have to submit by the end of next week. Some of you will have already started them, which is good and if you haven’t, well that’s OK but you’ll have to get a move on. So, let’s begin with you Simon. What’s happening with you?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>SIMON:</strong> Well, I’ve made a start on it. I’ve researched the background quite extensively last weekend and I should get to the writing stage tomorrow <span class="font-bold text-blue-500">(Q21)</span> with a bit of luck and I’ll get it finished at the weekend.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> What are you writing about?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>SIMON:</strong> I decided to look at the car manufacturing company, Jaguar, examine the problems they had with reliability <span class="font-bold text-blue-500">(Q22)</span> in the 1970s and 80s, how they dealt with it, and how it affected their marketing and sales strategy.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> That sounds pretty interesting. Any problems with that?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>SIMON:</strong> At the start I had problems getting information from that far back, but after rooting around in the library, I found some magazines which gave me information and also gave me references to find other stuff. It seems now the only problem is keeping to the 4,000 word limit <span class="font-bold text-blue-500">(Q23)</span>. It just seems that I have so much to write about. It seems I’ll need 5000 or even 6000 words to be able to cope.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Yes, your essay title seems to me to be very wide-ranging. Would you think about cutting out part of it? How about looking at their sales and marketing strategy but only mentioning the problems in the 70s and 80s and not going too far into it?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>SIMON:</strong> That’s a good idea. That will make it much easier to handle. By the way, how do you want us to hand in our work? Do you want us to drop in a hard copy to your office?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> You could do that but I’d prefer it if you just e-mailed it to me as an attachment <span class="font-bold text-blue-500">(Q24)</span>. You’ve all got my address. If not, give it to the secretary clearly marked that it’s for me. Right, Jennifer, how about you?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JENNIFER:</strong> I’ve not really got going on it yet but I’ve decided on a subject. I’ll try and do some research during the rest of this week and I should get writing this weekend.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> OK, what are you writing about then?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JENNIFER:</strong> I want to look into how supermarkets use market surveys to develop their products.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Will you have enough time to find out what sort of things that the supermarkets do? You won’t have much time for that.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JENNIFER:</strong> I should be OK. I’ve had a look in the stack system <span class="font-bold text-blue-500">(Q26)</span> in the library and I’ve found a magazine that surveyed all the UK major supermarkets and a trade publication that analysed the same things in Canadian supermarkets.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Be careful about using their conclusions <span class="font-bold text-blue-500">(Q27)</span> too much. The university takes a tough stance on plagiarism <span class="font-bold text-blue-500">(Q27)</span>. Make sure you properly list where you get your information from in a bibliography and try and do your own analysis. Get going too as that analysis will take a bit of time.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>JENNIFER:</strong> OK, thanks.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> And Melanie. How is your work going?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>MELANIE:</strong> I’m a bit behind I’m afraid. I was sick all last week and weekend with flu. I’ve got a subject I think but I’ve not done any work on it yet. Is there any chance I can get an extension <span class="font-bold text-blue-500">(Q28)</span> to the submittal date?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> The policy of the department is not to give any extensions unless there are extenuating circumstances. Do you have a doctor’s certificate or anything? <span class="font-bold text-blue-500">(Q29)</span></p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>MELANIE:</strong> I went to the doctor’s but I didn’t get a note as I didn’t realise I would need it. The doctor will have a record of me though as I got a prescription. I’ll go back and get one.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Yes, do. If you get one, then there shouldn’t be a problem getting an extension. Without it though, you’ll be in trouble. What subject are you considering anyway?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>MELANIE:</strong> I thought I’d do an overview of the UK mortgage interest rates <span class="font-bold text-blue-500">(Q30)</span> and their effect on housing sales trends over the last 10 years. I thought it might be of interest because of the huge increases of house prices over the last decade.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Certainly an interesting subject and it should be no great problem getting information as this has been fairly well documented. It’s a lot of work again though and you’ll really need to get cracking on it even with the extension – if you get one.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>MELANIE:</strong> Well, I’ve not got much on for the rest of the week and I’ve set aside the weekend to really get to grips with it.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg"><strong>TUTOR:</strong> Good. Now, is there anything else?</p>

                        Good afternoon and welcome to this Earth Sciences lecture. Today we’re going to look at tidal; or more correctly, tsunami.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section className="mt-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">

                        Deep below the ocean’s surface tectonic plates collide, and every once in a while, these forces produce an earthquake. The energy of such submarine earthquakes can produce tidal waves, which radiate out in all directions from the epicentre of the quake, moving at speeds of up to 500 miles per hour. When these waves reach shore, they can cause enormous destruction and loss of life. Tidal waves are actually miss named. They are not caused by tides. A more accurate word for them is the Japanese name tsunami, which means, harbour. They are also sometimes called seismic sea waves, since they can be caused by seismic disturbances such as submarine quakes. However, that name is not really accurate either, since tsunami can also be caused by landslides, volcanic eruptions, nuclear explosions, and even impacts of objects from outer space, such as meteorites, asteroids, and comets.

                        Earthquakes though are the largest cause of tsunami. Tectonic plates cover the world’s surface and their movement can be detected anywhere in the world. Some areas of the world are more prone to greater movement, and it is in these places that the largest waves can occur. Large vertical movements of the earth’s crust occur at plate boundaries which are known as faults. The Pacific Ocean’s denser oceanic plates are often known to slip under continental plates in a process known as subduction, and subduction earthquakes are the most effective in generating tsunamis. <strong className="text-blue-600 font-bold">(Q31)</strong>

                        A tsunami can be generated by any disturbance that displaces a large water mass from its equilibrium position. In the case of earthquake-generated tsunamis <strong className="text-blue-600 font-bold">(Q32)</strong>, the water column is disturbed by the uplift or subsidence of the sea floor. Submarine landslides, which often accompany large earthquakes, as well as collapses of volcanic edifices, can also disturb the overlying water column as sediment and rock slump down, and are redistributed across the sea floor. submarine volcanic eruptions can create an impulsive force that uplifts the water column and generates a tsunami. Conversely, super marine landslides and cosmic body impacts disturb the water from above, as momentum from falling debris is transferred to the water into which the debris falls. Generally speaking, tsunamis generated from these mechanisms, unlike the devastating Pacific-wide tsunamis caused by earthquakes, dissipate quickly and rarely affect coastlines distant from the source area.

                        Tsunamis are very hard to detect, since they cannot be seen when they are in the deep ocean.

                        The distance between two wave crests can be 500 kilometers and, because of this, the wave height is only a few feet. Because the rate at which a wave loses its energy is inversely related to its wavelength <strong className="text-blue-600 font-bold">(Q33)</strong>, tsunamis not only propagate at high speeds, they can also travel great, transoceanic distances with limited energy losses. As the tsunami reaches shallow water however, its speed decreases, but the energy it contains remains about the same. Instead of traveling fast, the wave rises high.

                        The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has set up a seismic detection system <strong className="text-blue-600 font-bold">(Q34)</strong> to monitor earthquakes and predict the possible arrival of tidal waves for Pacific countries. Buoys at sea <strong className="text-blue-600 font-bold">(Q35)</strong> can also detect water pressure changes that can indicate tsunamis moving through the ocean. But when tsunamis originate near the shore there is often little chance to warn people.
