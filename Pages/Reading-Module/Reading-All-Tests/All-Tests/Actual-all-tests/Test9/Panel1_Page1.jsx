        </div>
        <p className='text-justify'>
          Over the past few weeks, I have had the pleasure - and for the most part it really has been a pleasure - of visiting five of our most popular theme parks. I have looked at new attractions, tested my nerves on the big-thrill rides and waited patiently in queues. I took along my sons, aged seven and four, to see which attractions they most enjoyed.
          Here are my findings. I hope they will help you decide which park best suits you and your family. Many of the rides have height restrictions, so to avoid disappointment, check details on the relevant website before you set off. With the exception of Legoland, the parks have cafés and restaurants that sell very run-of-the-mill fast food, so I have recommended picnic spots where appropriate

        <p className='text-justify'>
          In an effort to improve its appeal to families with young children, the park has opened a high-quality aquarium, Sharkbait Reef by Sea Life. Also new is Cloud Cuckoo Land, which includes an impressive indoor soft play area and a rather average musical show.

        </div>
        <p className='text-justify'>
          The park's big draws are its daredevil, state-of-the-art roller-coasters which are genuine thrill rides. Those brave enough to tackle On Air are suspended under the track and "fly" face down. Rita has a terrifying high-speed launch. Oblivion is a sadistic, sheer drop into a black hole while Nemesis is said to be "The World's Most Intense Ride Experience" - it's not, but it is still a blast.
          There is excellent entertainment here for all the family. The amazingly elaborate Charlie and the Chocolate Factory ride is a highlight, ending with a simulated ride in a glass elevator. And if you are prepared to get absolutely soaked, Battle Galleons (basically a water pistol fight on a grand scale) is great fun.

          <div>Tips</div>
        </div>
        <p className='text-justify'>
          Plan your day carefully: given the size of the park, you don't want to find yourself zigzagging from one side to the other.
          Even on term-time weekdays, waits for the big rides can be more than half an hour, so consider investing in
          "Fastrack" tickets. There are various options: Fastrack Scream, for instance, allows you one ride each on Air, Nemesis and Oblivion for £8.
          Buy tickets in advance at www.altontowers.com Not only are they cheaper, but (new this year), you get access to some major rides an hour before the regular opening time.
          Alton Towers' enjoyable, Disneyesque hotels are a monorail ride from the park's entrance, and attached to a top-notch, Caribbean-themed and mostly indoor water park. Packages with theme-park entry include the early ride time privileges mentioned above.
          Best picnic spots: either on the lawns in front of the mansion, or in the tranquil landscaped gardens.
          0870 520 4060; www.altontowers.com Day tickets bought at the park: adults and over-11s, £36; ages 4-11, £27; family of four, £100.
