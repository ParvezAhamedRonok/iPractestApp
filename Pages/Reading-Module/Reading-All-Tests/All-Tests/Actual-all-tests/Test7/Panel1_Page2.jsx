                <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 mt-2 mb-3'>A</span>One does not have to be an optimist to believe that international tourism will grow substantially over the next century. Apparently, however, one does have to be an optimist to regard this as a good thing. As tourism has burgeoned in the latter half of the twentieth century it has been accused of many things: despoiler of environments, destroyer of cultures and exploiter of poor nations. Tourism, it is claimed, ultimately destroys the attractive features of a place and thus can neither sustain its resource base nor itself as an industry in the long term. If these charges are valid then tourism either should be severely restrained or will eventually burn itself out, but not before causing much damage. When looking to the end of this century this scenario gives little cause for optimism.

                <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 mt-2 mb-3'>B</span>It is possible, however, to regard tourism's future growth as not only assured but also highly desirable. That is not to suggest that tourism has not and will not cause problems but these are not insurmountable and are potentially outweighed by the opportunities for improving the human condition. International tourism is in its infancy and it is possible to learn from past mistakes. This optimist's view is that tourism will continue to grow, that the challenges consequently presented can be met, and that the ultimate outcome will be positive, depending on how well both the tourism industry and governments respond to those challenges.</p>

                <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 mt-2 mb-3'>C</span>By the end of the 21st century it is highly likely that vastly more people will travel more often to a wider range of international destinations. The trends are already apparent. In 1950 the top fifteen receiving countries accounted for 97% of all international arrivals, a share that had declined to 62% by 1999. Over the next twenty years arrivals are predicted to grow fastest in East Asia-Pacific, followed by Africa, the Middle East and South Asia. From 1985 to 1998 outbound travel growth from the developing countries of East Asia-Pacific averaged 8.5% per year compared to the global average of 5.3%. Clearly a consequence of economic prosperity is a realization of the desire to travel, and as this extends to other regions throughout the 21st century a continual supply of new travelers is assured. With time, increasing affluence should enable international travel to change from being an aspiration to an expectation for many more people, as has occurred in the economically developed world in the late 20th century.

            <p className=''>
                <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 mt-2 mb-3'>D</span>There are, however, reasons to believe that this future will not or should not be realised. One of the greatest uncertainties lies in at least maintaining the current historically low cost of international travel. With plans well advanced for the introduction of larger and more fuel-efficient aircraft the medium-term outlook is promising, but looking into the future there must be concerns about the increasing scarcity of oil. Maintaining low travel costs may be contingent on alternative power sources and continually improving technology. Given the scale of the international travel industry an optimist must believe that there is at least a substantial incentive to anticipate and counteract this.

                <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 mt-2 mb-3'>E</span>Technological developments such as the Internet and virtual reality may reduce the need or desire to travel. This notion can be summarily dismissed by considering the nature of the tourism experience and what motivates it. Tourism, in essence, is sensual, emotive and driven by a desire to experience a different place in more than two dimensions. The sights, sounds, smells, tastes, ambience and people are integral, as is the actual presence of the tourist within this milieu. Vicarious experiences can simulate some aspects but not the totality. Moreover they cannot provide the surprise discoveries, sense of adventure and chance encounters that real travel affords. It is more likely that the greater awareness of other places engendered by information technology will stimulate a desire to authenticate by direct experience

                <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 mt-2 mb-3'>F</span>Far more difficult to challenge is the claim that tourism is ultimately unsustainable because of its impacts on environments and cultures that then make destinations less appealing. International tourism is often portrayed as a juggernaut, consuming one destination after another and then rolling on. Tourism could become self-limiting in that accommodating the anticipated growth over the next twenty years then creates the conditions for a subsequent decline. Signs are emerging, however, that the tourism industry has learnt some valuable lessons on the downside of its 'success' and has taken steps to secure its own future. Codes of environmental ethics have burgeoned and environmental management initiatives have been developed in key industry sectors. While some of these efforts may be viewed cynically, they have served to raise awareness that tourism can do potential harm and placed sustainability firmly on the tourism agenda. The greatest risk is that such standards may only be selectively applied, and here the emerging destinations of the less developed world are under most threat.

                <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 mt-2 mb-3'>G</span> Less developed nations are particularly vulnerable. They possess environmental and cultural features that tourists wish to experience, given the right conditions. They also possess a powerful economic incentive to develop tourism rapidly and with as few constraints as possible. They lack capital to achieve this and consequently have frequently ceded control of tourism development to foreign interests. To attract capital they have offered concessions - tax breaks, liberal access to land and low environmental standards - which ultimately reduce the benefits. There is no easy solution to this dilemma, but ironically it may lie in the growth of tourism itself. The combination of a growing market, increasing diversification and rising levels of experience amongst tourists will lead to the industry constantly seeking new destinations. Bargaining power is likely to shift in favour of destinations, although this is certainly not in immediate prospect and relying on this solution may require some patience.

            <p className=''>
                <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 mt-2 mb-3'>H</span>The alternative, for all nations where the culture and environment are felt to be under threat, may be to focus on quality rather than quantity. This oft-promoted solution aims to reduce tourism's harmful effects without sacrificing economic benefits. The approach typically advocated is to provide high quality facilities and services and thereby attract high spending tourists, selective restraint operating through price. If adopted broadly it could constrain the growth of tourism below predicted levels, but will it be effective in achieving its aims, and is it socially desirable? In relation to the first question there must be doubts. High expenditure does not mean high yield, given that there are greater costs associated with providing higher quality. Its desirability depends on how the social benefits of traveling are perceived. The mere fact that tourism has grown so rapidly and that new countries have emerged as major markets as soon as their citizens have the economic means and freedom to travel implies that individuals perceive great benefits. In the 21st century do we wish to reverse a significant trend of the 20th and revert to the conditions of the 19th when only the most privileged could travel internationally?

            <p className=''>
                <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 mt-2 mb-3'>I</span>Other solutions must be sought to more directly mitigate the impacts of tourism without unduly constraining growth. With respect to environmental impacts there is a substantial, growing knowledge base, plus the technical means and legislative models to achieve this. A problem remains in relation to cultural impacts, however, because the issues are more complex. A pessimist would suggest that continued growth could dramatically transform cultures and create an homogenized world. An optimist would retort that cultural change is inevitable and not necessarily undesirable, and that tourism could counteract other change agents and actually help maintain cultures. Understanding this viewpoint requires an examination of the nature of both culture and international tourism, and the relationship between them.
