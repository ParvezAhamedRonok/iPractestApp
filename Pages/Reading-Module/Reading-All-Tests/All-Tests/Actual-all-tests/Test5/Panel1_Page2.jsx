                    <div className="mt-2 mb-3">Information Overload</div><br /> <br />
                    <p>Here are ten of my favorite ways to manage information:</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div className="mt-2 mb-3">
                <p className=''>
                    <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 '>A</span>Factor reference from action. Carve out action items, To Dos, and tasks from your incoming streams of information. If it’s not an action, it’s reference. I first learned this practice when I was dealing with information overload as a support engineer. I ended up cementing the idea while working on our Microsoft Knowledge Base. The Knowledge Base is a vast collection of information, where each article tends to be optimized around either action or reference.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div className="mt-2 mb-3">
                <p className=''>
                    <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 '>B</span> Create lists. Make a new To Do list each day and use it to organize your key action items for the day. Create checklists for your common routines.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="mt-2 mb-3">
                <p className=''>
                    <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 '>C</span>Create collections. Put things into collections or think in terms of collections. Consolidate your notes into a single collection that you access quickly, such as in a personal notebook, a Word document or etc. Consolidate your thoughts or ideas into a single collection. Consolidate reference examples of your heroes or stories you can use for inspiration. Consolidate your “ah-has” into a single collection. Note that by single collection, I don’t mean you have it all in a single document, although you can. Instead, I’m thinking of collections of items, much like a photo album music collection. By stashing things of a similar type, such as “idea” or “note” ... etc., you can determine the best way to arrange that collection. Maybe it’s a simple A -Z list or maybe you arrange it by time. For example, when I keep a journal of my insights, and each time I get an “ah ha”, I write it down under the current date. This way I can easily flip back through days and see my insights in chronological order. While I could arrange them A - Z, I like having my most recent ideas or inspirations bubbled to the top, since chances are I’m finding ways to act on them.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div className="mt-2 mb-3">
                <p className=''>
                    <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 '>D</span>Put things where you look for them. Where ever you look for it, that’s where it should be. If you keep looking for something in a certain place, either just put it there when you find it or add some sort of pointer to the actual location. While you might logically think something belongs in a certain place, the real test is where you intuitively look for it.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div className="mt-2 mb-3">
                <p className=''>
                    <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 '>E</span>  Keep things flat. Out of sight, out of mind holds true for information. Avoid nesting information. Keep it flat and simple where you can. Think in terms of iTunes or a playlist. A well organized playlist is easy to jump to what you need.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div className="mt-2 mb-3">
                <p className=''>
                    <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 '>F</span>   Organize long lists or folders using A-Z. When you have long lists or big collections, then listing things A-Z tends to be a simple way to store things and to look things up fast. Once a list gets long, A-Z or a numbered list is the way to go.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div className="mt-2 mb-3">
                <p className=''>
                    <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 '>G</span> Archive old things. When information is no longer useful for you, consider archiving it to get it out of your way. This usually means having a separate location. I’m a pack rat and I have a hard time letting things go, so I tend to archive instead. It let’s me get things out of the way, and then eventually get rid of them if I need to. Archiving has really helped me get a ton of information out of my way, since I know I can easily rehydrate it if I need to.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div className="mt-2 mb-3">
                <p className=''>
                    <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 '>H</span>  Bubble up key things to the top. When you have a lot of information, rather than worry about organizing all of it, bubble up things to the top. You can effectively have a quick, simple list or key things up top, followed by more information. Keep the things up front simple. This way you get the benefits of both exhaustive or complete, as well as simple. Whenever you have a large body of information, just add a simple entry point or key take aways or summary up front.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div className="mt-2 mb-3">
                <p className=''>
                    <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 '>I</span>Know whether you’re optimizing for storing or retrieving. Distinguish whether you are storing something because you will need to look it up or refer to it a lot, or if you are simply storing it because you might need it in the future. For information that I need to look up a lot, I create a view or I make it easy to get to the information fast. For example, I might use a sticky note since I can quickly put it wherever I need to. For a lot of information, you simply need a quick way to store it. What you don’t want to do is have to work to hard, each time you need to file a piece of information. This I is where having a place for things, using lists, and organizing information in a meaningful way comes in handy. For most of my reference information, I organize it either by A-Z or by time. This way I don’t have to think too hard. I don’t create a bunch of folders for my email. Instead, I just store it all flat so it’s easy to search or browse or sort. For example, if I need to find an email from somebody, I simply sort my email by their name. Just by asking the question whether you’re optimizing for fast filing or for fast lookup will get you improving your information management in the right direction.

                </p>

                <p className=''>
                    <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 '>J</span> Create views. Create views for the information that you need to frequently access. For example, you might put sticky notes of information that consolidate just the key things. As an analogy, think of your music store versus your playlists. You store might be a large collection organized A-Z, but your playlists are views that are more focused or have themes. You can apply this metaphor to any of your information collections.

                <p className=''>
                    <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 '>A</span>Joe Swanberg makes films about the romantic lives of young urbanites. He shoots quickly with a digital camera and asks actors to wear their own clothes. His films, which tend to cost between $30,000 and $50,000 to make, are almost never shown in cinemas. Instead they are available on pay-television as video-on-demand, as downloads from iTunes (Apples digital store) or as DVDs. By keeping his costs down and distributing digitally, Mr Swanberg is making a living.

                </p>
            </div>
            <div className="mt-2 mb-3">
                <p className=''>
                    <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 '>B</span> Technology was expected to help young artists like Mr Swanberg. In 2006 Chris Anderson, the author of “The Long Tail”, predicted that the internet would vastly increase the supply of niche media products and bring audiences to them. That has certainly happened. But so has the opposite. In film, music, television and books, blockbusters are tightening their grip on audiences and advertisers. The growth of obscure products has come at the expense of things that are merely quite popular. The loser in a world of almost limitless entertainment choice is not the hit, but the near-miss.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="mt-2 mb-3">
                <p className=''>
                    <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 '>C</span>There are several reasons for this. Some are as old as Charles Dickens (or perhaps even Homer). People still want to have something to talk about with their friends. Thus “American Idol” and “The X-Factor” do pretty much as well as TV hits did ten years ago, “New Moon” set a new record at the box office and bestselling books sell better than ever. Research shows that people enjoy hits more than they do obscure stuff, often because they are the only thing that many people try in that genre: lucky Dan Brown and Katie Price.

            </div>
            <div className="mt-2 mb-3">
                <p className=''>
                    <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 '>D</span>But some things are new. All that technology that has made niche content so much more accessible has also proved handy for pushing blockbusters. Missed “Twilight”, the predecessor of “New Moon”? There will be other chances to catch it, in a wide variety of formats. Technology helps hits zip around the world, too-even in the art market.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div className="mt-2 mb-3">
                <p className=''>
                    <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 '>E</span>Blockbusters are doing well not in spite of the fact that people have more choice in entertainment, but because of it. Imagine walking into a music shop containing 4m songs (the number available on We7, a free music-streaming service in Britain) or more than 10m (the choice on iTunes), all of them arranged alphabetically in plain boxes. The choice would be overwhelming. It is far easier to grab the thing everybody is talking about or that you heard on the radio that morning.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div className="mt-2 mb-3">
                <p className=''>
                    <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 '>F</span>Is this increasing polarisation into blockbusters and niches good or bad? It certainly makes life harder for media companies. In a world of growing entertainment options it is more important than ever to make a splash. Miss the top of the chart, even by a little, and your product ends up fighting for attention along with thousands-perhaps millions-of other offerings. That prospect makes for jitters and, sometimes, conservatism. Broadcast television programmes must succeed quickly or they will be cancelled. It is becoming even harder to talk studio bosses into approving some kinds of film. Want to make a complicated political drama, based on an original screenplay, with expensive actors in exotic locations? Good luck with that.
                </p>

            <div className="mt-2 mb-3">
                <p className=''>
                    <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 '>G</span> Yet the challenge for the moguls is a boon to consumers. In the past firms made a lot of money supplying content that was not too objectionable to people who did not have much of a choice. In a world of hugely expanded options they cannot get away with this. These days there is rarely nothing good on television. So media companies must raise their game.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div className="mt-2 mb-3">
                <p className=''>
                    <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 '>H</span>  Creative types who are accustomed to lavishing money on moderately appealing projects will have to do more with less. Or they must learn how to move between big-budget blockbusters and niche, small-budget fare, observing the different genre and budget constraints that apply in these worlds. A few forward-looking folk, such as Steven Soderbergh, a film-maker, are already doing this. Some will find shelter. Premium television channels such as HBO, which are built on passion more than popularity, offer some protection from chill market winds. So do state broadcasters like the BBC.

                <p className=''>
                    <span className='text-xl font-bold mr-2 '>I</span>Thinking people naturally deplore the rise of lowest-common-denominator blockbusters, and wish that more money were available to produce the kind of music, films and television programmes they like. The problem is that everybody has different ideas about exactly what they want to see. Some may thrill to a documentary about Leica cameras; others may want to spend an hour being told how to cook a better bouillabaisse. But not many want to do either of these things, which explains why such programmes are niche products. There are only a few things that can be guaranteed to delight large numbers of people. They are known as blockbusters.
